The approach leverages\nthe full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,\nallowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual\nand textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass\ncodes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%\nprecision at five and four levels of classification, significantly\noutperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing\nfull-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,\noffering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual\narchives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of\nLLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities."}

To address this fundamental challenge, we\nreframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We\nintroduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the\nmodel to identify and correct its own errors.

Across each stage, we synthesize\nrepresentative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify\ntheir limitations.\n  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,\nincluding KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic\nsystems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim\nto clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging\nsymbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the\ndevelopment of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems."}

Despite its importance, this task\nremains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal\nconsistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to\naddress this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental\ntrade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas\ncapturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling\nlong-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo\nmatching.

Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by\nmarginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.\n  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a\ntext, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a\ndownside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by\nthe LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be\nacquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the\napproximation.

Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late\nfusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level\nattributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed\non multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross\nvalidation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The\nfused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted\nF1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or\nmissing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and\nimproves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme\nclasses are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to\ndepression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas\nattributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers\nreproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective\nclinical decision making."}

Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what\napproximate notions of replicability is learning possible?\n  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the\ncontext of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any\nfixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the\nlearner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution\nconsistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally\nuse shared unlabeled samples.

A human preference can be\nvisualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent\ntrade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity).

This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often\naddress this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the\nfull spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's\nrequest reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's\ncentral tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,\ntraining-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus.

By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide\ninterpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,\nand syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational\nrepresentations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well\nas incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be\nmore limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation\nand linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid\napproach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with\nthe symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational\nrepresentations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for\nrephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source\nof information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic\nNLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for\nincremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and\ninterpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along\nwith symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid\nmethod works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline."}

However,\npersonalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge\ndue to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept\ndistributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation\nframework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).\nOur approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step\ndiffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained\nsimultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the\nstudent, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the\nEchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure\nconsistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is\noptimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and\nwith alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.\nFurthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,\nwherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to\nfeedback to the teacher model.

For further transparency, Grad-CAM is\nintegrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving\nprediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical\ninterpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\\% accuracy on the 7K-DS\ndataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\\% and 99.85\\% in the 3-class\nand 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model\ngeneralizes with 95.77\\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art\nmethods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user\ninterface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor\nlocalization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and\ndeployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for\nreliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis."}

Existing hierarchical forecasting methods\ntypically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply\na reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values\nare coherent across the hierarchy.

To address this issue, we propose a\nthresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability\nnormalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather\nthan predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing\nstudies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then\nthe time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support\neffective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without\ncomputationally expensive numerical improper integration.

(3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line\nchunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive\nat 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting\nacross budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across\nconfigurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word\nsplitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide\nevidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG\nsystems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational\nefficiency."}

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size.

This dynamic adjustment improves the model\nability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC\nimages. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,\nwhich effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,\nenhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is\nfurther optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the\ntraining procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image\nquality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as\nGamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and\nPix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution\nand feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to\nstandardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale\nfrequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for\nbetter feature representation.

However, the connection\nbetween these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on\nKLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to\njoint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based\ninformation increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.\nFurthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives\nand observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier\ntrained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational\nlower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound\nis tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to\nstate-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of\nestablished reference scenarios.

We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives.

A Head Agent provides\nguidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands\nHSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table\nrow/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes\ncanonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional\nrefinement loop to resolve detected contradictions.

We prove that, in a\nnonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private\nlatent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the\nglobal structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which\nthoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with\ntheoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a\nframework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication\nand assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing\npatterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as\nmost observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate\nthe collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work\nilluminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges\nremain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of\ncompute or data scale."}

However, dental\nimaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic\nartifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity\narising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often\nproves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to\nthese issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis\nand treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as\nthe most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature\nextraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent\nprogress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL\nresearch-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the\nbasic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and\nacquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational\ntechniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to\ndifferent DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization\nstrategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize\ncommonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we\ndiscuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential\nfuture directions.

Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical\nnotes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)\nmethods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical\nnotes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories\nrelated to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine\nlearning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic\nRegression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language\nmodels (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).\nModels used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated\ncategories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1\nscores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot\nprompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities\nextraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning\nunderperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and\nClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods\nserved as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in\ntoxicities.\n  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine\nlearning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small\ntraining data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare\ncategories.\n  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine\ntreatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong\npotential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance."}

Our analysis\nreveals substantial domain dependent variation in self-reflection\neffectiveness, with performance gains up to 220\\% in mathematical reasoning. We\nfurther investigate how reflection round depth and feedback mechanism quality\ninfluence performance across model families. To validate our findings in a\nreal-world setting, we deploy a self-reflection enhanced marketing content\nlocalisation system at Lounge by Zalando, where it shows market-dependent\neffectiveness, reinforcing the importance of domain specific evaluation when\ndeploying these techniques. Our results provide actionable guidance for\nselecting optimal inference strategies given specific domains and resource\nconstraints. We open source our self-reflection implementation for\nreproducibility at\nhttps://github.com/aws-samples/sample-genai-reflection-for-bedrock."}

Additionally, extra\nfine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate\nprecision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address\nthis issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead\nwithout compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared\nbatch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing\nquantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation\ndistributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child\nmodel to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based\nimportance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and\nViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior\naccuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x.

We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel\nrepresentations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates\nat fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where\nuncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination\nprobability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \\leq\nf(\\sigma^2((1-\\rho(P))/P + \\rho(P)), \\mu^2)$, which predicts that language\nmodels need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce\nND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA\nadapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces\nhallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general\naccuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,\ncausal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and\ncorrelational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is\nassociated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent\noptimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal\nneurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third\naxis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the\nreliability of language models at fixed budgets."}

Motivated by these insights, we\nintroduce $\\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory\nflow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation.

Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding.

Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home."}
