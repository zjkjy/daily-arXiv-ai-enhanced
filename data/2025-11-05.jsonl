However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\nmodel-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address\nthis gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and\nJapanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,\ncomplementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task\nArithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated\nfrom 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an\nexpert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while\nmerging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain\nskills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is\nhyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust.

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning.

To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in\nboth structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns\n(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show\nhigh agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic\nPET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET\nsynthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)\noutperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while\ncombining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).\nAblation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt\nengineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes\nrealistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial\npattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's\ndisease."}

We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally\nsmall learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this\nregime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a\nsubset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we\nderive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first\nlayer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training\nprocess using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed\ngeneralization and representation learning characteristic of grokking."}

We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that\nintegrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the\nprecision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings."}

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual\ncortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary\ncognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the\nextraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing\nsubject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike\nconventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and\nheavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates\neach reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast\nand clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon\nacceptance of the paper."}

As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in\nimproving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over\nnoisy and fading multiple-access channels."}

We\nfurther demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a\nwell-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,\nSGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\\tr(\\mH)$,\nwhereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\\tr(\\Diag(\\mH)^{1/2})$ instead.
