This paper examines the interplay between\nKV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like\nmeta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of\npositional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking\nframework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the\naccumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window\n(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory\nexhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via\nAttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.\nBecause LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a\ncache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to\ndegenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving\ncontiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial \"gist\") can yield more\ncoherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate\nfor eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional\nstructure, and view \"cache health\" holistically beyond mere size."}

This work\naddresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that\nleverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of\ntraditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human\nintervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation\nmodel, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration.

This approach significantly reduces\nthe need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,\nproviding an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply\nstate-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks.

Drawing on multiple\ncurated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,\nrevealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well\nas anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.\nComparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,\ndomain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models\ndemonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro\nF1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup\n(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline\nclassifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including\nLayer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues\nthat drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression\nfrom suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned\ntransformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,\nwhile also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and\nhuman-in-the-loop safety protocols.

Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully\nconcentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with\nAUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study\ninvolving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the\nmethod as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human\nreaders with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the\nmost anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least\nanomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human\nrankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable\nagreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This\nmethod is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows\ndevelopers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and\npinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a\nsynthetic dataset."}

The benchmark\ncomprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five\ncomplexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading\nproprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a\none-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against\nhidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even\ntop-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the\nproblems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural\nlanguage. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of\nperformance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of\nsolution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time\nand memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work\ndemonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating\nlarge language models, especially in underrepresented languages.

This predict-then-optimize paradigm has\nmotivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how\nthe optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream\ndecisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art\nmethods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific\nsurrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,\noften a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the\ndownstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a\nsimple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing\nsolver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection\nproblems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and\nshortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by\nsolving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains\non dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)\nas refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard\nsupervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that\nDGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,\nand show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art\nDFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training\ntime.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context\ninjection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the\ngeneration process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on\nthe model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with\nuser-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output\nquality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we\npropose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that\nredefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from\nalignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a\nhigh-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly\nrewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection\nmodule is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning\nis employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core\npersonalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to\nuser-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to\nfurther refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.\nComprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by\ndecoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of\nexplicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO\nintroduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be\nseamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new\nand effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios."}

In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting\nwhere the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.\nTo capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we\nintroduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the\nmismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show\nthat if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We\npropose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear\nregret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We\nalso establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm\nachieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the\nnumber of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results\nthrough comprehensive numerical experiments."}

We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned\nNowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike\nmost deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into\nphysically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion\nand intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a\nlead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable\nadvection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both\nGOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,\nManaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics\nover 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and\nhybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in\nmost settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds.

Several previous studies have tried to enhance\nthe spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert\nencoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.\nTo enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual\nSpatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with\nhuman-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We\nfirst attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a\nlarge-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning\n19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present\nVST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in\nspace. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement\nlearning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the\nside-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\\%$ on\nMMSI-Bench and $61.2\\%$ on VSIBench.

In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal\nsearch as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching\nvideo clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate\nsearch decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content\nand inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO\nwith Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video\nframes from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy\nmodel to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the\ncompleteness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets\nspecifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task\ndifficulty and improve temporal search capabilities.

To\nbetter leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a\nsimple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight\narithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the\nweight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired\nbehavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this\ndirection to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate\nsycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often\ngeneralizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger\nout-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.\nWe also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering\ncan partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and\nunder-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance\ngains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can\nbe detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an\n\"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the\nevolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that\nnever manifest during training or evaluations."}

However,\nthese models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high\ncomputational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we\npresent the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to\nsubstantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph\ntoken merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while\nmaintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing\nassumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights\nthat many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for\nscalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show\nconsistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to\nassess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into\nthe development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

Nevertheless, training these\nmodels on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited\naccuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling\nand weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in\nregions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive\nweighting component balances the convergence rate across training points.\nNumerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only\nadaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate\npredictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method\nemphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem\ndependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently\nimproves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust\napproach for solving PDEs with PINNs."}
