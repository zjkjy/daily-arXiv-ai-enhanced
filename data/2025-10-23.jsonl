A curated corpus of\napproximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading\npeer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and\nEarth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was\nconstructed.

This approach, unlike LLMs such as\nChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying\nsubstantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,\nmulti-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative\nfindings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and\ntopical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM\nprovides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research\npriorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.\nOverall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for\napplications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction\nanalyses, and educational purposes."}

PoSh is replicable,\ninterpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics\n(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new\ndataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with\nexpert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with\ngranular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,\nDOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed\nimage description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh\nachieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\\rho$) with the human judgments\nin DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type\n(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward\nfunction, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we\ncharacterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the\npaintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models\nstruggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene\ndynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both\nPoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as\nassistive text generation."}

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference.

In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations.

We explore\nthe challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and\ncompositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.\nAdditionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,\nevaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based\non their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning\nstrategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from\ntrue mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future\ndirections, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state\nmodeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based\nmistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to\nenhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains."}

Rather than LLMs, I\ndeveloped a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and\ncost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using\nfreely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of\napproximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading\npeer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and\nEarth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was\nconstructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting\nrelevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search\ntechniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as\nChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying\nsubstantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,\nmulti-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative\nfindings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and\ntopical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM\nprovides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research\npriorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.\nOverall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for\napplications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction\nanalyses, and educational purposes."}

Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is\ncharacterized by its unique \"intra-class clusters\" property, which presents two\nmajor challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.\nThese characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,\nsignificantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers\nfor highly imbalanced data.

In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems.

On\nImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an\naverage bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods\nunder comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10\nsystematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative\ncomponent, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design."}

We evaluate our approach for\nsentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi\n(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our\nresults show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and\nCPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2\npoints over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more\neffectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with\nlarger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged\ncheckpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.\nWe further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on\nEn-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than\nmonolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs\n0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more\nreliable substrate for low-resource pairs.

These rules often feature vague boundaries\nand implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for\nagents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current\nagent benchmarks.\n  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level\ne-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical\nrule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided\nby these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products\nwith noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World\nCustoms Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from\nreal-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed\nHSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,\nwith these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.\n  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,\nand closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves\nonly 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,\ndetailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,\nand test-time scaling fails to improve performance further."}

While\nrecent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,\nthe synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still\nrequires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm\nnamed Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and\ntrajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit\nplanning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free\nfuture state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,\nPWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable\nplanning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we\nfurther introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,\nequipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.\nDespite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.\nCode and model weights will be released at\nhttps://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model."}

However, the research community's progress remains constrained\nby the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets\nbuilt from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust\nfoundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided\nimage editing models."}
