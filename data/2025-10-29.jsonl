In practice, we typically employ the pairwise $t$-test\nto compare outcomes between the treatment and control groups, thereby assessing\nthe effectiveness of a given strategy. To be trustworthy, these experiments\nmust keep Type I error (i.e., false positive rate) under control; otherwise, we\nmay launch harmful strategies. However, in real-world applications, we find\nthat A/B testing often fails to deliver reliable results. When the data\ndistribution departs from normality or when the treatment and control groups\ndiffer in sample size, the commonly used pairwise $t$-test is no longer\ntrustworthy. In this paper, we quantify how skewed, long tailed data and\nunequal allocation distort error rates and derive explicit formulas for the\nminimum sample size required for the $t$-test to remain valid. We find that\nmany online feedback metrics require hundreds of millions samples to ensure\nreliable A/B testing.

Furthermore, a geometric model\nis implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.\nThis model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of\nthe camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the\ndataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of\nnegative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the\nfeasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with\nregression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the\ndevelopment of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic\nenvironments."}

However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by\ndefault, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the\nreal-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability\nwhen an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has\npassed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often\neither over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or\nunder-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge,\nwe introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across\n34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user\nquestion, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed\nsince the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue\nmessages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and\nevolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples,\ncreating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous\nobservation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call\n(prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with\nhuman preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show\nthat without time information, most models perform only slightly better than\nrandom, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding\ntimestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the\nimprovement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive,\nprompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness.

However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained\nrepresentations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability\nsimultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation\ninterpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable\nsemantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,\nonly the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas\nthe uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we\npropose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the\ninformation loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies\nthe representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation\ninterpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that\nthe interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,\nrepresentations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable\nsemantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further\nsupports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the\nclassifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with\ninterpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for\nthe representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with\nless accuracy degradation.

While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia\ndetection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in\nfeature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.\nTo address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional\nNeural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature\nextraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for\npneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a\nquanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2\nimage patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling\nlayers to generate non-classical feature representations. These\nquantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves\na higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable\nclassical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and\nsample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the\nfoundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical\ndiagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to\ntraditional approaches."}

To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the\nfirst cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual\nsemantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a\ntarget-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly\nassigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization.

Since\nparametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization\nmethod involves a model-specific dataset construction process that\ndifferentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,\nwe distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those\noccurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To\nvalidate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,\nwhich relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model\nactivations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge\ncategorization by showing a significant difference between the two\nhallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and\nhallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do\noccur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we\nidentify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models\nhallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We\nintroduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation\nmethods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on\naverage, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in\nhallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that\nconsider the hallucination underlying factors."}

We revisit this\nlimitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional\ndifferences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space\nand the parameter space.

In this study, we introduce a\nphysics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution\nIndependent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,\naddressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but\nsufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent\nembedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained\nbasis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal\ncoordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are\nenforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation\nand performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical\nexamples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at\nvarying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations."}

A machine learning\nmodel based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset\nthat includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations\nusing a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate\nreservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite\nimagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the\nproposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the\nshoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR\nperformance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and\ncoefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the\nrobustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution\nfor continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The\nproposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the\nresulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate\nchange and environmental patterns."}

This\nlimitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To\naddress this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,\nwhich we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors\n(DCIC-sgp).

While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy.

Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of\nmissing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications\nwhere the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to\nbe monitored, due to budget constraints.

However,\nthis assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by\nboth the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the\nperformance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current\nstudies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally\nAutocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed\nto systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic\nforecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a\nrandom Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a\nspatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic\ndependencies.

Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge\nby exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on\ntheir own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,\nwhich is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component\nof robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and\nevaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated\nLearning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their\ngeneralization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a\nsingle communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the\nconsidered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach\nof FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),\nextending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an\nadaptive personalization factor.

Previous research has\ndemonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden\ndimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to\nthe widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive\nlow-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed\nbottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply\nRoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of\nRoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a\nhigher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent\nspace, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS\nprojects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and\nperforms sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this\nspace. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the\noverhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on\nvarious tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and\nadditionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with\nLLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA\nperformance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS\nachieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention\noperator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end\nthroughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared\nto GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively."}

For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of\nbillions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual\nscreening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available\ncompounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.\nFurthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course\nof a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms\ntypically offer little room for amortization.

Despite\nadvances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer\nknowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).\nA key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across\nLLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility\nand broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural\nincompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences\nbetween LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer\nparameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic\nalignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale\nknowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our\napproach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.\nLeveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and\noutperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.\nEvaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a\nnovel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the\ndata generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data\nvia downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight\nallocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic\nsample.

However, the impact of such role prompts on model\nreasoning capabilities remains unclear. This\n  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to\nevaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,\n  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.\nWe test this framework on three medical QA\n  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to\nassess changes in reasoning pathways.

We\naddress this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our\nempirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of\nground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final\nanswer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a\ndense entity-aware reward function.
