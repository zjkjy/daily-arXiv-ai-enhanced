Abstract: Articulated objects are prevalent in daily life and robotic manipulation tasks. However, compared to rigid objects, pose tracking for articulated objects remains an underexplored problem due to their inherent kinematic constraints. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel point-pair-based pose tracking framework, termed \textbf{PPF-Tracker}. The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of PPF-Tracker in multi-frame pose tracking of articulated objects. We believe this work can foster advances in robotics, embodied intelligence, and augmented reality. Codes are available at https://github.com/mengxh20/PPFTracker.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗参考动画实现精确的运动控制，使用双时钟去噪策略平衡运动保真度和自然动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 利用用户友好的操作获取粗参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在指定运动区域强制强对齐，在其他区域保持灵活性。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实性和运动控制方面达到或超过现有基于训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种无需训练的运动和外观控制视频生成解决方案，超越了仅基于文本提示的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [4] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化基于修复的说话人脸生成中的嘴唇泄漏问题，通过三种互补的测试设置和衍生指标来建立更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持视频细节的同时修改嘴唇运动，但容易引入嘴唇泄漏问题，即生成的嘴唇受到参考图像的影响而非仅由驱动音频控制，这一问题难以用标准指标检测。

Method: 提出包含三种互补测试设置的系统评估框架：静音输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对、匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入嘴唇同步差异和基于静音音频的嘴唇同步得分等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效分析和量化嘴唇泄漏问题，并研究不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法是模型无关的，为说话人脸生成领域的未来研究建立了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态监控中的行人跟踪问题，在复杂遮挡环境下实现了约90%的检测跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，需要开发能够应对动态无人机监控挑战的新数据集和框架。

Method: 提出MATRIX数据集（8个同步无人机动态拍摄）和深度学习框架，包括实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准、鸟瞰图多视图特征融合。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%的检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，迁移学习显示强泛化能力，相机丢失实验显示优雅性能下降。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视图监控系统提供了重要基准，展示了在实际部署中的实用鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定的子内存库，通过最近邻匹配机制实现最先进的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别的子内存库，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出一个所有任务共享统一内存库的CAD框架，在训练期间通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在推理阶段通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%的异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时提高了持续异常检测的灵活性和可扩展性，在实际场景中表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，解决传感器噪声和及时可靠预测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事故预测对主动安全自动驾驶至关重要，但面临两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声/退化，以及需要平衡早期预警与误报抑制的及时可靠预测。

Method: 集成扩散去噪模块（通过迭代细化重建噪声弹性特征）与时间感知actor-critic模型（利用长期时间推理和时间加权奖励确定最佳预警时机）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上实现最先进精度，显著提高平均事故前时间，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类对齐的预测，具有实际安全关键部署的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RS-Net框架，通过空间交互和长程时间上下文对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，提升动态场景图生成性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的物体对上训练，缺乏对非相关物体对的指导，导致在推理时难以识别有意义的关系

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（带可学习上下文标记）和时间编码器（聚合视频级信息），通过关系评分机制增强关系预测

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，RS-Net持续提升Recall和Precision，尤其在平均Recall上有显著提升，能有效处理关系的长尾分布

Conclusion: RS-Net能轻松集成到现有DSGG模型中，无需架构修改，在保持竞争性效率的同时实现了优于最先进方法的性能

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名化适配器模块从视频特征中移除隐私信息，同时保持任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在共享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息，而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型，不适合视频基础模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护视频特征中的隐私信息，减少性别偏见，促进更公平的视频理解，且计算负担小。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优缩放策略存在显著差异，生成任务需要数据量以3-5倍更快的速度增长。随着分辨率提高，模型规模需要比数据规模增长得更快，计算能力是主要瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，为未来大规模视觉模型发展提供指导。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件在32x32分辨率图像上训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量（Fr'echet距离）。

Result: 发现最优缩放策略高度依赖具体任务，在固定分辨率下生成任务需要数据量以3-5倍更快速度增长；随着分辨率提高，模型规模需要比数据规模增长得更快；计算能力是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 基于计算能力每年增长4-5倍的预测，未来5年内有望实现逐像素图像建模的可行性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成更准确的平衡训练数据，缓解数据偏见问题，在严重偏见情况下表现优于现有去偏方法。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Conclusion: DT-NVS在真实世界日常场景的新视角合成方面表现出色，超越了现有方法，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的旋转不变学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野受限而无法区分几何相似但空间不同结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工制作的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然对任意旋转具有鲁棒性，但会丢失全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间不同的结构（如飞机左右机翼）。

Method: 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过从学习的共享旋转中推导全局一致参考点（阴影）来增强局部RI描述符；设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)将SiPF集成到特征聚合过程中；基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分能力的任务中。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入全局一致的参考点机制，在保持旋转不变性的同时保留了全局姿态感知能力，有效解决了翼尖特征崩溃问题，提升了模型对结构相似组件的区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

*Riling Wei,Kelu Yao,Chuanguang Yang,Jin Wang,Zhuoyan Gao,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种非对称跨模态知识蒸馏（ACKD）方法，通过学生友好匹配模块和语义感知知识对齐模块，解决弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识传输问题，在遥感场景分类任务中取得了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中配对模态数据有限，对称跨模态知识蒸馏（SCKD）应用受限。因此需要研究在弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识学习，即非对称跨模态知识蒸馏（ACKD）。

Method: 提出SemBridge框架，包含：1）学生友好匹配模块，利用自监督学习获取语义知识，为每个学生样本动态选择相关教师样本；2）语义感知知识对齐模块，采用拉格朗日优化寻找最优传输路径。

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架相比7种现有方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ACKD方法能够有效处理弱语义一致性的跨模态知识传输问题，SemBridge框架通过动态样本匹配和最优传输路径优化，显著提升了知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个融合视觉预测和LLM结构先验的半监督文档布局理解框架，通过概率加权方法提升检测性能，在少量标注数据下达到接近全监督方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档布局理解任务仍然需要大量标注数据，现有半监督方法未能充分利用文本结构信息。希望结合LLM的结构先验知识来增强半监督检测性能。

Method: 使用OCR-LLM流水线推断文档层次结构区域，通过逆方差融合将教师检测器输出与LLM结构先验结合，生成精炼的伪标签。采用实例自适应门控机制优化权重分配。

Result: 在PubLayNet数据集上，使用5%标注数据：SwiftFormer达到88.2±0.3 AP；LayoutLMv3达到89.7±0.4 AP，超越标准半监督方法，匹配需要海量预训练的UDOP。LLM提供18.7%案例的语义消歧，带来+3.8 AP增益。

Conclusion: LLM结构先验与视觉检测器互补，可显著提升半监督文档布局理解性能，支持隐私保护部署，成本可控。

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN目标检测的形状依赖性缺陷，特别是在训练数据中未包含的姿势下性能下降的问题，为灾难救援等形状不可预测场景提供可行方案。

Method: 利用服装的光谱反射特性开发形状无关的人员检测方法，在资源受限的边缘设备上实现系统部署。

Result: 处理速度达到23.2 fps（253x190像素），在模拟搜救场景中平均精度达93.5%，优于对比CNN模型的最佳精度53.8%，误报率极低。

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是CNN检测器的替代品，而是在特定条件下（如形状不可预测的灾难救援环境）的补充工具，光谱检测方法在边缘设备实时操作中具有可行性。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Motivation: 文本训练方法在零样本图像描述中面临跨域泛化能力差的问题，容易产生幻觉内容。现有检索方法可能加剧幻觉，因为检索到的描述可能包含与输入无关的实体。

Method: 提出负实体抑制(NES)方法，包含三个阶段：使用合成图像确保图像到文本检索的一致性；从检索内容中过滤负实体；应用注意力级抑制来减少幻觉倾向特征的影响。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NES在保持竞争性域内性能的同时，提高了跨域迁移能力并降低了幻觉率，在零样本图像描述中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过负实体抑制机制显著提升了跨域泛化能力，为文本训练方法提供了有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Motivation: 现有的人机协同压缩方法主要基于人类视觉压缩流程，在整合机器视觉压缩时存在复杂度和比特率方面的不足。机器视觉仅关注图像/视频的核心区域，所需信息远少于人类视觉压缩。

Method: 提出基于机器视觉导向的压缩方法，开发即插即用的可变比特率策略，逐步聚合机器视觉压缩的语义信息，并利用扩散先验无缝恢复人类视觉的高保真细节。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功实现了以机器视觉为基础的人机协同压缩，为同时服务于人类感知和机器智能的图像/视频数据压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分层蒸馏（HD）框架，将轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏从独立范式转变为协同组件，通过轨迹蒸馏建立结构"草图"，为后续基于分布的细化阶段提供近最优初始化，并引入自适应加权判别器（AWD）来改进对抗训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的推理延迟是其实时应用的关键障碍。现有的轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏方法存在根本性权衡：轨迹蒸馏方法保留全局结构但牺牲高频细节，而分布蒸馏方法可实现更高保真度但存在模式崩溃和不稳定训练问题。

Method: 1. 分层蒸馏框架：将轨迹蒸馏作为结构"草图"生成器，为分布蒸馏提供近最优初始化；2. 改进对抗训练：引入自适应加权判别器（AWD），通过动态分配token权重来关注局部缺陷，实现高效细节细化。

Conclusion: 该方法为高保真单步扩散模型建立了一个稳健的新范式，通过协同利用轨迹蒸馏和分布蒸馏的优势，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BRHVC的双向参考协调视频压缩方法，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合技术，优化了双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了现有最先进的神经视频压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相对于P帧压缩研究较少，虽然双向参考帧能提供更好的压缩性能，但层次编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层次上，两个参考帧的贡献可能不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合。BMC通过收敛多个光流实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿，BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明BRHVC超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超过了传统编码VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考帧，实现优越的压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于豪斯多夫维数（HD）的新方法FGM-HD，通过可学习的HD估计、动量调度策略和HD引导拒绝采样，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了分形生成模型（FGM）的输出多样性，在ImageNet数据集上实现了39%的多样性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分形生成模型（FGMs）虽然能生成高质量图像，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。为了解决这一问题，作者引入豪斯多夫维数（HD）这一分形几何概念来量化结构复杂性，旨在增强生成输出的多样性。

Method: 1. 提出可学习的HD估计方法，直接从图像嵌入预测HD以解决计算成本问题；2. 在训练阶段采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动调度策略，逐步优化超参数；3. 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样来选择几何结构更丰富的输出。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGMs实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了可比的图像质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将豪斯多夫维数引入分形生成模型的工作，不仅有效增强了生成输出的多样性，还为FGM的发展提供了有原则的理论贡献。

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

TL;DR: AuthSig是一个基于生成模型和水印的静态电子签名框架，通过将认证信息嵌入签名图像来解决静态签名易被恶意复制和重用的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，传统纸质签名转向电子格式。虽然存在动态压力敏感和PKI数字签名，但静态扫描签名因其便利性仍广泛使用。然而这些静态图像几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且易受恶意复制和重用。

Method: 利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特性，AuthSig在生成过程中精细调节风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位，实现"一次签名，一次使用"策略。为解决手写签名数据稀缺和传统增强方法限制，提出了关键点驱动的数据增强策略来增强风格多样性以支持鲁棒水印嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下实现了超过98%的提取准确率，在打印扫描场景下仍保持有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig通过将认证信息绑定到签名图像，有效解决了静态电子签名的安全验证问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

TL;DR: T-Rex-Omni是一个新颖的开放集目标检测框架，通过引入负视觉提示来抑制视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物，解决了现有方法仅依赖正提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开放集目标检测器仅依赖基于文本描述或视觉示例的正提示，在面对视觉相似但语义不同的干扰物时表现脆弱。需要引入负提示来增强模型的辨别能力。

Method: 1) 统一的视觉提示编码器联合处理正负视觉提示；2) 无需训练的负向否定计算模块动态抑制负响应；3) 负向否定铰链损失通过微调增强正负嵌入的区分度。

Result: 在零样本检测中表现出色，显著缩小了视觉提示与文本提示方法之间的性能差距，在长尾场景中表现尤为突出（LVIS-minival上达到51.2 AP_r）。

Conclusion: 负提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni支持灵活的正负推理模式，能够处理用户指定或自动生成的负例。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Conclusion: Owl通过因果建模和注意力重加权有效缓解了对象幻觉问题，为大型视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Existing unsupervised image alignment methods exhibit limited accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a dense cross-scale image alignment model. It takes into account the correlations between cross-scale features to decrease the alignment difficulty. Our model supports flexible trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency by adjusting the number of scales utilized. Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且深度和可控性有限。需要开发能够跨领域泛化、支持交互和长视野预测的通用世界模型。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测（GLP）架构，结合基于大语言模型的自动回归潜在动态骨干（支持语言指定动作条件）和视频扩散解码器（重建感知细节和时间连贯的视觉观察），实现推理与现实的统一。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Motivation: 现有测试时对抗攻击方法（TTC）由于对抗攻击和对抗攻击之间优化目标的根本差异，仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成对抗攻击，导致搜索空间受限，对抗攻击可能过拟合有限的对抗模式，缺乏多样性来完全中和广泛的扰动。

Conclusion: 增强对抗攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提高测试时防御中的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过正交梯度方向和动量更新有效扩展了对抗攻击空间的探索，提高了扰动多样性，从而更好地中和对抗扰动。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了Kuzushiji识别中噪声处理的数据空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准平台。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average.

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）和两个MLLM模型上的实验表明，TACO始终优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统性偏差并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的忠实度，证明了其在缓解幻觉问题方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出RichKD方法，通过融合传统教师模型和CLIP的视觉-语言知识来增强多教师知识蒸馏，利用多提示文本指导提升监督质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性，忽略了跨模态表示的潜力。CLIP的视觉-语言知识作为补充监督源在知识蒸馏中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出简单有效的框架，将传统教师的logits和特征与CLIP的logits和特征进行融合，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，捕获数据集特定和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Result: 融合后的教师产生更自信可靠的预测，显著增加自信正确案例，减少自信错误案例。与CLIP融合能优化整个logit分布，为非目标类生成语义有意义的概率，提高类间一致性和蒸馏质量。

Conclusion: RichKD方法在多个基准测试中持续优于现有基线方法，并在分布偏移和输入损坏下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQ-PETR是一个针对PETR系列3D检测模型的全量化框架，通过量化友好的位置嵌入、双查找表和非线性算子优化，在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时降低75%延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PETR系列模型在3D检测基准上表现出色，但面临高计算成本和内存占用的部署挑战。现有量化方法直接应用于PETR会导致严重精度下降，主要由于多模态特征幅度差异和非线性算子量化效率低的问题。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）量化友好的LiDAR射线位置嵌入（QFPE），用单点采样替代多点采样；2）双查找表（DULUT）近似复杂非线性函数；3）数值稳定后量化（QANS）减少注意力失真。

Result: 在PETR、StreamPETR、PETRv2、MV2d等模型上，FQ-PETR在W8A8量化下实现接近浮点精度（仅1%性能下降），同时减少高达75%的延迟，显著优于现有PTQ和QAT基线方法。

Conclusion: FQ-PETR有效解决了PETR系列模型量化部署的挑战，在保持高精度的同时大幅提升推理效率，为自动驾驶3D检测模型的实用化部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Flora的零样本骨架动作识别方法，通过灵活的邻居感知语义调整和开放形式分布感知流分类器，解决了现有方法中的点对点对齐脆弱性和分类器决策边界僵化问题。


<details>

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，即使在仅使用10%可见数据训练时也表现出特别令人印象深刻的性能。

Conclusion: Flora方法通过创新的语义调整和流分类器设计，有效解决了零样本骨架动作识别中的关键挑战，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Conclusion: 该框架通过迭代视觉优化实现了鲁棒、域不变的定位，新基准数据集为基于视觉的支气管镜导航标准化进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每帧姿态，无法有效处理模糊动作和泛化到真实场景。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合动作感知推理和时间想象力。

Method: 提出DreamPose3D框架：1）使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2）引入表示编码器，在注意力机制中融入运动学关节亲和力；3）幻觉姿态解码器在训练期间预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准数据集上的广泛实验显示，在所有指标上都达到了最先进的性能。在广播棒球数据集上的测试进一步验证了其鲁棒性，即使面对模糊和嘈杂的2D输入也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理和时间想象力，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能，特别是在处理时间一致性和意图驱动运动变化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Result: 在多个数据集上，GMTRouter始终优于强基线，准确率提高0.9%至21.6%，AUC提高0.006至0.309，并能仅用少样本数据适应新用户和动态变化的偏好。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过异构图建模有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下实现了高性能的个性化路由，无需大量微调即可适应新用户和偏好变化。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟社交媒体群组对话的能力，发现LLM生成的对话有39%的时间被误认为是人类创作的内容，特别是Llama 3生成的对话仅有56%的正确识别率，略高于随机概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs为模拟在线社区和社交媒体提供了新途径，但其模拟各种用户之间对话的有效性尚未得到充分测试。本研究旨在验证LLMs能否令人信服地模仿社交媒体上的人类群组对话。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实的人类对话，并使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o两个LLM在同一主题上生成人工对话。将这些对话并排呈现给研究参与者进行识别。

Result: LLM生成的对话被误认为是人类创作内容的概率为39%。特别是Llama 3生成的对话，参与者正确识别为AI生成的概率仅为56%，略高于随机概率。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话来欺骗人类读者，这既显示了社交模拟的潜力，也警示了LLMs可能被滥用来生成新的不真实社交媒体内容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在法律分析中的双重性：既能解读复杂法律条款，又存在生成危险内容的漏洞。通过知识图谱和RAG技术评估LLMs对生物武器法律的理解能力、法律意图判断和安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs解读复杂法律框架具有巨大潜力，但这些模型在生成危险内容方面存在严重安全漏洞，需要系统评估其法律理解和安全机制。

Method: 提出结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成(RAG)的方法论，通过结构化实验评估LLMs识别法律违规、生成禁止指令和检测非法意图的能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在法律推理和安全机制方面存在显著局限性，但指出了改进方向。

Conclusion: 通过增强安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，可以开发出能够道德安全地协助敏感法律领域的LLMs，确保其成为法律的保护者而非违反者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在复杂多步推理场景中效果有限，大多数方法依赖结果监督，缺乏对中间步骤的明确指导，导致奖励破解和响应质量下降。

Method: 提出了Bi-RAR框架，基于Kolmogorov复杂度引入双向信息距离来评估每个中间步骤的信息完整性，采用多目标强化学习框架和级联奖励结构来优化推理过程。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试上的实证结果表明，Bi-RAR超越了先前的方法，并在训练和推理过程中实现了与搜索引擎的高效交互和推理。

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估和强化学习优化，显著提升了检索增强生成在复杂推理任务中的性能，为多步推理提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

TL;DR: LLM对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）显著降低了模型输出的多样性，作者提出Soft Preference Learning方法来解决这个问题，通过解耦KL散度惩罚中的熵和交叉熵项来精细控制生成多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对社会影响日益重要，但其输出多样性在偏好学习算法中显著降低，导致模型过度重视多数意见、牺牲多样性，需要新的方法来平衡对齐和多样性。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解耦KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。

Result: 使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务中准确率更高，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性，能代表更广泛的社会观点，并改善了logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能够有效提升LLM输出的多样性而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题严重阻碍了大型语言模型在高风险领域的实际部署，需要系统评估模型在对抗性提示下的真实性表现。

Method: 采用三步框架：1) 让LLM生成特定封闭领域内的真假陈述；2) 让LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 对五个主流专有LLM在两个封闭领域（热门电影和小说）的评估显示：Claude表现出强韧性，GPT和Grok中等韧性，Gemini和DeepSeek韧性较弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多的人使用LLM进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，表明需要提高模型对对抗性提示的抵抗力。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

TL;DR: 本文提出Self-HarmLLM攻击场景，利用模型自身生成的缓和有害查询作为新输入进行越狱攻击，实验显示在零样本和少样本条件下分别达到33%和41%的越狱成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御措施假设攻击者来自外部，但模型自身输出可能成为新的攻击向量，这一可能性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用同一模型生成的缓和有害查询作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B上进行实验，采用基于前缀的自动评估和人工评估。

Result: 零样本条件下转换成功率最高52%，越狱成功率最高33%；少样本条件下转换成功率最高65%，越狱成功率最高41%。自动评估平均高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑护栏设计并建立更稳健的评估方法，自动评估单独使用不足以准确判断有害性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语语言病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时费力。通用大语言模型虽然能生成文本，但缺乏领域专业知识，容易产生幻觉且需要大量专家修订。

Method: 开发了多模型RAG系统原型，整合了精选领域知识与工程化提示模板，支持五种商业（GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro）和开源（Llama 3.2、Qwen 2.5-7B）大语言模型。设计了七个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景。

Result: 概念验证证明了RAG增强生成儿科言语语言病理学案例的技术可行性。商业模型显示出边际质量优势，但开源替代方案达到了可接受的性能，表明隐私保护机构部署的潜力。整合精选知识库使内容生成符合专业指南。

Conclusion: 该系统展示了自动生成儿科言语语言病理学临床案例的可行性，未来应用可扩展到临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成和临床反思培训，但需要专家评审、学生试点测试和心理测量评估等广泛验证。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

Motivation: 将DisCoCirc形式主义从英语扩展到孟加拉语，评估其在英孟翻译任务中的有效性，并重新评估该框架在减少语言官僚主义方面的能力。

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法驱动框架，开发孟加拉语版本，应用于英孟翻译任务，分析框架在处理语言结构差异时的表现。

Result: 研究发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译中仍面临限制，即使对相对简单的句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在跨语言翻译中存在局限性，与先前声称的效果不符，这凸显了框架的约束并指出了未来改进的空间。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

Conclusion: GrADS方法能够高效选择代表性样本，在显著减少训练数据量的同时提升模型性能并缓解灾难性遗忘，具有重要的效率和成本效益。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

Motivation: 了解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述可以为疾病相关的认知和情绪变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 开发并比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型，以及在零样本和少样本设置下评估的GPT-4o mini模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微平均0.74，宏平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别中表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠性质，该任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Method: 通过严格的标注流程构建BNLI数据集，强调语义清晰性和蕴含、矛盾、中立类别的平衡，并使用最先进的基于Transformer的架构进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，BNLI在孟加拉语文本中捕捉复杂语义关系方面表现出更高的可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: BNLI为推进孟加拉语和其他低资源语言推理任务研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

*Yaxin Zhao,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluClean是一个轻量级、任务无关的框架，用于检测和修正大语言模型生成文本中的幻觉内容，通过规划-执行-修订的三阶段推理增强范式，在零样本设置下显著提升事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但经常产生幻觉内容，影响事实可靠性，需要开发有效的检测和修正方法。

Method: 采用推理增强范式，将过程分解为规划、执行和修订三个阶段，使用最小任务路由提示实现跨领域的零样本泛化，不依赖外部知识源或监督检测器。

Result: 在问答、对话、摘要、数学应用题和矛盾检测五个代表性任务上的实验表明，HalluClean显著提高了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean框架能够有效增强大语言模型输出的可信度，在现实应用中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiDAR是一种序列级混合架构，在单个前向传播中并行生成草稿标记（Thinking）并自回归采样最终输出（Talking），实现了扩散模型的高吞吐量与自回归模型质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法无法有效平衡扩散模型并行生成优势与自回归模型质量优势的问题，寻求在保持高质量的同时实现高吞吐量和高GPU利用率。

Method: 使用结构化注意力掩码设计，在单个前向传播中同时进行扩散模型的并行草稿生成（Thinking）和自回归的最终输出采样（Talking）。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上优于推测解码，在效率和质量上超越Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次实现了与自回归模型质量相当的同时提供4.71x到5.91x的每秒token生成速度。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功弥合了扩散模型与自回归模型之间的质量差距，同时保持了扩散模型的并行生成优势，为语言模型生成提供了新的高效架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

*Longfei Zuo,Barbara Plank,Siyao Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EVADE框架，使用大型语言模型生成和验证解释来检测自然语言推理任务中的标注错误，相比传统的人工两轮标注方法更高效且能提升数据集质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异使得难以区分标注错误和合理变异。传统VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高昂且可能限制合理标签或解释的覆盖范围。

Method: 提出EVADE框架，利用大型语言模型生成和验证解释来检测错误。通过分布比较、验证重叠和对模型微调的影响，全面比较人类和LLM检测的错误。

Result: LLM验证使生成的解释分布更接近人类标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工识别的错误能带来更好的微调性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异下数据集的质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

*Shengmin Piao,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpiralThinker是一个统一的潜在推理框架，通过迭代更新潜在表示实现扩展的隐式推理，无需生成额外标记。结合渐进对齐目标和结构化注释，在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，也没有系统的方法来交织隐式和显式推理。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，在潜在表示上执行迭代更新，实现扩展的隐式推理；使用渐进对齐目标和结构化注释来维持潜在推理和文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在所有基准测试中始终超越先前方法，实现了潜在推理方法中的最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理，证明对齐的迭代更新可以在潜在空间中可靠地引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于轨迹的情感支持评估框架，从静态评估转向动态评估，通过模拟真实情绪变化场景来评估大语言模型在长期情感支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估主要依赖简短静态对话，无法捕捉情感支持的动态和长期特性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含328个情感情境和1152个干扰事件的大规模基准，采用经过验证的情绪调节策略约束模型输出，将用户情绪轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，并应用因果调整的情绪估计方法。

Result: 提出了三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）来捕捉用户情绪动态，通过对多种大语言模型的广泛评估揭示了情感支持能力的显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为长期情感支持性能提供了全面评估，并为模型开发提供了可行的见解，证明了轨迹评估方法在情感支持领域的重要性。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段神经符号框架，通过LLM将自然语言政策形式化，并在推理时进行自动形式化验证，确保逻辑正确性，在严格监管行业实现超过99%的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在金融、医疗等严格监管行业中由于随机性限制而无法可靠应用的问题，需要确保政策执行的逻辑正确性。

Method: 两阶段框架：(1)使用LLM在可选人工指导下将自然语言政策形式化；(2)推理时自动形式化验证自然语言陈述的逻辑正确性，通过多重冗余形式化步骤进行语义等价交叉检查。

Result: 基准测试显示该方法超过99%的可靠性，在识别逻辑有效性方面接近零误报率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生可审计的逻辑工件来验证结果，并可用于改进原始文本，为严格监管行业提供可靠的LLM应用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合CTC/注意力架构的安多藏语流式语音识别框架，采用上下文感知动态分块机制，结合外部语言模型提升语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定分块方法在藏语语音识别中的上下文截断问题，适应不同语速并捕捉藏语的语言学特征。

Method: 使用混合CTC/注意力架构，引入上下文感知动态分块机制自适应调整分块宽度，构建基于藏语正字法原则的词典，集成外部语言模型进行解码。

Result: 在测试集上达到6.23%的词错误率，相比固定分块基线相对提升48.15%，显著降低识别延迟且性能接近全局解码。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了上下文截断问题，在保持接近全局解码性能的同时显著提升了安多藏语流式语音识别的准确性和效率。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

*Ritsu Sakabe,Hwichan Kim,Tosho Hirasawa,Mamoru Komachi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成Oogiri回答时能达到中低水平人类表现，但缺乏同理心，这解释了它们无法复制人类幽默评估的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常依赖单维度评估（如是否"有趣"），而本文认为需要多维度理解幽默，填补了这一空白。

Method: 扩展Oogiri数据集，用LLMs生成回答，然后人工标注六个维度的5分绝对评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、同理心和整体趣味性。

Result: LLMs生成回答水平介于中低层次人类表现之间，但明显缺乏同理心。相关性分析显示LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑同理心。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默评估标准上与人类存在根本分歧，释放标注语料库以推动开发更具情感智能的对话系统。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DoPE的训练自由方法，通过检测特征图中的异常频率带并重新参数化，有效解决了RoPE在Transformer模型中的长度外推限制，显著提升了长上下文任务中的检索准确性和推理稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE)在Transformer模型中存在固有的长度外推限制，这削弱了模型处理长序列的能力。

Method: 将带位置编码的注意力图重新解释为噪声特征图，提出基于截断矩阵熵的DoPE方法来检测特征图中的异常频率带，并利用特征图的噪声特性，通过无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现稳健的外推。

Result: 在needle-in-a-haystack和many-shot in-context learning任务上的实验表明，DoPE在扩展上下文（最多64K tokens）中显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 去噪位置编码策略有效缓解了注意力下沉现象，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为改进长度泛化提供了一个简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoopTool是一个完全自动化的模型感知数据演化框架，通过紧密集成数据合成和模型训练来增强LLM的工具使用能力。它通过三个协同模块迭代优化数据和模型：能力诊断、标签验证和错误驱动数据扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具学习受到静态合成数据管道的限制，数据生成和模型训练是分离的非交互过程，无法自适应关注模型的具体弱点，且存在噪声标签问题，降低了训练效率。

Method: LoopTool包含三个协同模块：(1)贪婪能力探测(GCP)诊断模型已掌握和失败的能力；(2)判断引导标签验证(JGLV)使用开源判断模型查找和纠正标注错误；(3)错误驱动数据扩展(EDDE)基于识别出的失败生成新的挑战性样本。

Result: 实验表明，使用LoopTool训练的8B模型显著超越了其32B数据生成器，在BFCL-v3和ACEBench基准测试中达到了其规模的最新最先进结果。

Conclusion: 闭环自精炼数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，且可在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，无需依赖昂贵的闭源API。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了表格问答中LLM无法处理复杂表格结构的问题，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型以进一步提高性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

*Amal Sunny,Advay Gupta,Vishnu Sreekumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文验证了基于上下文的sequentiality度量方法，相比原始版本能更好地与人类对文章组织和连贯性的评估对齐，在自动作文评分中表现出更好的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对先前研究中sequentiality度量方法存在的问题——主题选择可能混淆结果且缺乏与真实流畅度度量的验证，本文旨在验证仅使用上下文术语作为更概念有效和可解释替代方案的提议。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的论文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较上下文版本sequentiality与人类对语篇层面特征（如组织和连贯性）评估的一致性，并将其与标准语言特征结合进行预测分析。

Result: 上下文版本的sequentiality与人类对组织和连贯性评估更一致；虽然零样本提示的LLM在预测特征分数方面更准确，但上下文度量与标准语言特征结合时比主题版本和原始sequentiality公式增加更多预测价值，且优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分和相关NLP任务，突显了显式建模句子间流动的价值。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了子词分割在学习过程中的动态变化，通过扩展子词分段语言模型来支持预训练和微调，分析了三种不同形态类型语言的子词演化规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子词分割通常在预处理阶段固定，本文探索在训练过程中动态优化子词分割的学习动态，特别是研究子词在预训练和微调过程中的演化规律。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架以支持预训练和微调，针对三种形态类型不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)进行训练，从语言学角度分析子词动态变化。

Result: 识别出子词学习的四个阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性；微调过程中子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能改善低资源形态复杂语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习子词分割为低资源、形态复杂语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词在学习过程中会动态演化并适应不同任务需求。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型在可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）框架下的诚实对齐问题，特别是在演绎推理任务中。作者发现现有方法在早期训练中容易崩溃，提出了Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹来稳定学习过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法主要优化最终任务结果，在早期训练中当负奖励占主导时容易导致模型崩溃。这在诚实对齐任务中尤为突出，因为模型不仅需要回答可解答的查询，还需要识别无法从前提得出结论的情况。

Method: 作者构建了两个基于图结构的多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），并在半数实例中随机扰动边来创建不可回答的情况。提出了Anchor方法，通过在rollout中注入真实轨迹来防止早期训练崩溃。

Result: 实验发现GRPO方法在这些任务上表现不佳，课程学习有一定帮助但需要精心设计的数据集。Anchor方法显著稳定了学习过程，提高了整体推理性能。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于在语言模型中实现可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过注入真实轨迹有效解决了早期训练崩溃问题，提升了诚实对齐的效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

Conclusion: POTSA通过最优传输有效弥合了高低资源语言翻译差距，显著提升了多语言语音翻译性能。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

TL;DR: C$^3$TG是一个两阶段框架，用于细粒度、多维度的文本属性控制，通过选择性配对LLM与属性分类器，结合加权KL散度和基于能量函数的迭代优化来解决属性冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在控制生成文本的特定属性时存在局限性，难以实现精确的多属性控制，特别是在属性需求冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在控制生成流程中融入迭代优化过程。

Method: 提出C$^3$TG两阶段框架：生成阶段选择性配对LLM与17个可用维度中的属性分类器，使用加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段利用结合分类器分数和惩罚项的能量函数，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明C$^3$TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低了毒性，实现了无需昂贵模型修改的多维文本属性控制。

Conclusion: C$^3$TG是一个有效且灵活的解决方案，能够同时精确控制多个维度，同时保持自然文本流，为多维文本属性控制提供了新的方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人们有不同的创意写作偏好，但现有LLM通常将不同个人品味视为整体进行训练，需要适应每个用户的偏好来提升个性化创意写作能力。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读偏好数据，包括自述偏好和对100对创意写作文本的标注偏好；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模；采用LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好差异。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在分歧；2) 微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体实际偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3) 自述偏好在建模实际偏好方面效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术发展奠定了基础，展示了建模个人偏好的可行性，并揭示了自述偏好与实际偏好之间的差异。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理不同长度的序列输入（如自然语言句子），导致性能不佳，需要动态调整删除率以适应输入特性。

Method: 引入AdaptDel方法，采用可适应删除率动态调整基于输入属性，扩展随机平滑理论框架到可变率删除，确保对编辑距离的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得强实证结果，认证区域的中值基数相比最先进认证方法提升高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率有效解决了序列分类中编辑距离扰动的认证鲁棒性问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，评估发现前沿VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，但开源模型仅37-45%，且闭源模型在元认知推理增加时表现崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更具挑战性的基准来评估模型的实际推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,460道JEE Advanced考试题目的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学、数学，评估17个最先进模型的表现。

Result: 前沿VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%，闭源模型在元认知推理增加时表现大幅下降（GPT-5仅修复5.2%错误）。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准能够有效区分模型的训练质量和推理能力，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估多模态推理提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Conclusion: SeerSC框架通过系统1和系统2的协同工作，有效解决了测试时扩展中的令牌效率和延迟问题，为LLM推理优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMaPO通过自适应边界设计解决离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，提升排序准确性和下游对齐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法存在过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排序样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），对错误排序样本提供不足修正信号（欠拟合），限制了排序准确性提升

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用基于Z归一化和指数缩放的实例级自适应边界，动态重新分配学习努力：放大错误排序样本的梯度，抑制正确排序样本的梯度

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO实现了更好的排序准确性和更优的下游对齐性能，针对性分析确认成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边界设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在低资源语言上的性能不足，特别是在开源科学社区中缺乏可比较的结果。本文旨在为低资源语言巴斯克语开发强大的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 开发了自有的训练和评估图像-文本数据集，使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语适配的Latxa两种大型语言模型作为骨干，探索了多种数据混合训练策略。

Result: 研究表明：i) 仅需约20%的巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准测试中获得稳定结果；ii) 出乎意料的是，无需巴斯克语指令骨干模型也能获得强大的巴斯克语多模态模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发其他低资源语言的多模态大语言模型开辟了道路，并通过公开释放资源促进相关研究。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

### [98] [Accelerating Training Speed of Tiny Recursive Models via Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653)
*Kaleem Ullah Qasim,Jiashu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著提升递归推理模型的训练效率。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，仅损失0.63%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型通过迭代精炼在复杂推理任务上表现优异，但训练计算成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了广泛应用和研究。

Method: CGAR包含两个协同组件：1）渐进深度课程：在训练过程中动态调整递归深度从浅到深配置；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失加权与观测到的梯度幅度衰减对齐。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上，CGAR实现1.71倍训练加速（10.93到6.38小时，成本降低42%），准确率仅下降0.63%（86.65%到86.02%）。渐进深度课程单独实现2.26倍加速和85.47%准确率。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在适度硬件上实现高效训练，同时提升推理效率（100%停止准确率和11%更少推理步骤）。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

Motivation: 研究图粗化问题，旨在在保持图结构关键信息的同时减少图的规模，这对于处理大规模图数据具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了两种算法：Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC)迭代合并局部失真最小的节点对；$k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC)基于成对失真度量的聚类直接合并节点簇。

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务上的验证表明，所提方法在广泛的参数和场景下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法能够有效减少图规模同时保持结构信息，在多种应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Method: 提出LyapInf方法，假设Lyapunov函数为二次型，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知二次算子，从系统轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数。

Conclusion: LyapInf方法为黑盒动态系统提供了一种有效的稳定性分析工具，能够仅从轨迹数据推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Motivation: 现有MARL方法依赖静态或每步关系图，忽略了智能体适应、移动或重组合作策略时自然出现的时间演化交互，捕获这种演化依赖关系对于实现稳健和自适应协调至关重要。

Method: TIGER构建MARL智能体的动态时间图，连接当前和历史交互，使用时序注意力编码器聚合结构和时序邻域信息，生成时间感知的智能体嵌入来指导合作策略学习。

Conclusion: TIGER通过显式建模时间演化的协调结构，有效提升了多智能体强化学习的协调能力和适应性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意目标，为引导分子生成提供了统一且模型无关的框架。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

*Pragya Singh,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种GNN无关的图超分辨率框架：Bi-SR通过二分图连接低分辨率和高分辨率节点实现结构感知的节点超分辨率，DEFEND通过将高分辨率边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示。在真实脑连接组数据集上取得了最先进性能，并引入了12个模拟数据集用于全面基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图超分辨率方法存在两个关键限制：基于矩阵的节点超分辨率忽略了图结构且缺乏排列不变性；依赖节点表示推断边权重限制了可扩展性和表达能力。这促使开发更有效的图超分辨率方法，特别是在资源受限的医学领域。

Method: 提出了两种GNN无关框架：1) Bi-SR使用二分图连接LR和HR节点，实现结构感知且保持拓扑和排列不变性的节点超分辨率；2) DEFEND通过将HR边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示，允许使用标准基于节点的GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两个框架在七个拓扑度量上都达到了最先进的性能。同时引入了12个新的模拟数据集，能够捕捉多样化的拓扑结构和LR-HR关系。

Conclusion: 所提出的Bi-SR和DEFEND框架有效解决了现有图超分辨率方法的局限性，在保持图结构特性和可扩展性方面表现出色，为图超分辨率研究提供了新的基准和评估标准。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了随机参数分解（SPD）方法到Transformer模型，提出了适用于序列数据的因果重要性函数和新损失函数，在玩具模型和GPT-2-small上成功分解出可解释的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的方法在玩具模型上取得了成功，但尚未扩展到真实模型。本文旨在弥合这一差距，将SPD方法扩展到现代Transformer模型。

Method: 扩展随机参数分解（SPD）到Transformer模型，提出更新的因果重要性函数（适用于序列数据）和新的损失函数。

Result: 成功分解了玩具归纳头模型并恢复了预期的2步电路；在GPT-2-small中成功定位了对应"高尔夫"和"篮球"等可解释概念的子组件。

Conclusion: 这是将SPD扩展到现代模型的第一步，表明可以使用该方法发现可解释的参数空间机制。

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

TL;DR: ForeSWE是一个新的概率时空预测模型，结合深度学习和经典概率技术，用于预测雪水当量(SWE)，在西部美国512个SNOTEL站点数据上表现出比现有方法更好的预测精度和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SWE预测具有挑战性，因为受多种因素影响且具有时空变异性。传统方法未能充分利用时空相关性，也不提供不确定性估计，而这对水资源管理决策者很重要。

Method: 提出ForeSWE模型，结合注意力机制整合时空特征和交互，以及高斯过程模块提供预测不确定性的原则性量化。

Result: 在西部美国512个SNOTEL站点数据上的评估显示，相比现有方法，在预测精度和预测区间方面都有显著改进，并突出了不同方法在不确定性估计方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为水资源管理社区的部署和反馈提供了平台，表明ForeSWE模型在SWE预测方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个设备无关、抗噪声的脑电图基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入、噪声感知掩码重建和字典卷积变换层解决EEG分析中的设备差异和低信噪比问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同设备和配置导致的数据集变异性，(2)脑电信号信噪比低，脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源噪声淹没。

Method: 引入位置通道嵌入处理设备差异；采用噪声感知掩码重建策略，训练模型重建去噪信号而非原始噪声信号；提出字典卷积变换层将信号投影到结构化特征空间。

Result: 在来自不同设备的数据集上，EEG-X在多个下游EEG任务中优于最先进方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X通过创新的位置嵌入和噪声鲁棒性设计，成功解决了EEG基础模型面临的关键挑战，在跨设备和跨任务场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合Transformer编码器和CNN聚合器的两阶段架构，系统性地研究了在睡眠分期中加入临床元数据和专家事件注释等上下文信息的效果，在SHHS数据集上显著提升了分期准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工睡眠分期耗时且存在评分者间差异，现有深度学习模型主要依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：Transformer-based每时段编码器结合1D CNN聚合器，系统融合受试者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和每时段专家事件注释（呼吸暂停、血氧下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）。

Result: 相比仅使用PSG的基线模型（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，事件注释贡献最大增益。特征融合优于多任务学习替代方案。

Conclusion: 将临床有意义特征与学习表示结合可显著提升性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG导联或额外传感器，为实现上下文感知的专家对齐睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了光谱可预测性指标Ω，用于快速筛选时间序列预测模型。研究发现当Ω值高时，大型时间序列基础模型优于轻量级模型，但当Ω值低时优势消失。Ω计算快速，可作为实用的初步筛选工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测模型部署中的困境：全面验证多个模型计算成本过高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。需要一个快速评估指标来指导模型选择。

Method: 使用光谱可预测性Ω作为信号处理指标，在四个不同领域进行受控实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 当Ω值高时，大型时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线；当Ω值下降时，这种优势消失。Ω计算仅需数秒，能有效分层模型性能。

Conclusion: Ω提供了一个实用的初步筛选工具，可降低验证成本，同时强调需要开发在真正困难（低Ω）问题上表现出色的模型，而不仅仅是优化简单问题。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Conclusion: 该工作为公平医疗AI系统提供了实践进展和理论洞见，证明了DAT+Group-DRO统一框架的有效性。

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出DIVO方法，通过扩散模型生成高质量状态-动作样本，利用优势值加权机制平衡保守性和探索性，在离线强化学习中解决价值高估问题。

Motivation: 离线强化学习中，分布外动作导致的价值高估问题严重限制策略性能。现有扩散模型方法对低质量数据集中的冗余动作应用无差别正则化，导致过度保守和扩散模型表达能力与效率的不平衡。

Method: 提出DIVO方法：1）引入基于动作优势值的二元加权机制指导扩散模型训练；2）在策略改进阶段动态筛选高回报潜力动作；3）实现保守性与探索性的平衡。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，DIVO在运动任务上实现显著平均回报提升，在具有稀疏奖励挑战的AntMaze领域优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIVO通过价值条件优化有效平衡了离线RL中的保守性和探索性，利用扩散模型的分布匹配能力生成高质量样本，显著提升策略性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations utilizing a diverse collection of company transaction datasets spanning multiple downstream tasks, thereby enabling a thorough assessment of TGPT's effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to established methodologies. Furthermore, we examine the incorporation of LLM-derived embeddings within TGPT and benchmark its performance against fine-tuned LLMs, demonstrating that TGPT achieves superior predictive accuracy as well as faster training and inference. We anticipate that the architectural innovations and practical guidelines from this work will advance foundation models for transaction-like data and catalyze future research in this emerging field.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过准确重构TAC值，有效解决了现有防御方法识别精度低的问题，在各种场景下均优于现有防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）方法，通过将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数，并使用标准化流估计潜在空间的条件分布，从而解决传统VAE生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型已成为2022年后的SOTA生成模型，但传统模型如VAE和GAN的改进工作停滞不前。作者希望探索条件变分自编码器（CVAE）在图像生成中的应用，以在图像中融入所需属性。

Method: 1. 将高斯解码器的方差作为训练过程中的可学习参数；2. 使用标准化流（normalizing flows）估计给定标签的潜在空间条件分布，而不是假设其等于先验分布。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法将FID（Fréchet Inception Distance）降低了5%，并将对数似然提高了7.7%，表明图像生成质量得到显著改善。

Conclusion: 通过改进CVAE的训练方法和潜在空间建模，可以有效提升图像生成的质量和多样性，为传统生成模型的进一步发展提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE框架能够有效提高下游决策的可靠性，为微调后的大语言模型提供校准的不确定性估计。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计将试验转化为适应性模块化研究，使每个模型迭代都能生成I级证据，加速AI向常规护理的成本效益转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在高维非欧几里得流形上聚类数据的高效框架，通过p-Fréchet映射将流形数据嵌入到低维欧几里得空间，然后应用标准欧几里得聚类技术如k-means。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准内在方法在高维非欧几里得流形上聚类的计算挑战，特别是针对对称正定矩阵流形SPD(n)等复杂流形。

Method: 使用p-Fréchet映射F^p将流形数据嵌入到低维欧几里得空间，然后应用标准欧几里得聚类算法。在欧几里得空间和SPD(n)流形上严格分析了F^p的数学性质。

Result: 数值实验显示性能显著提升：与内在流形方法相比，运行时间减少了高达两个数量级，同时保持高聚类精度，包括现有替代方法难以处理的情况。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维非欧几里得流形上的数据聚类提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，特别适用于复杂流形如SPD(n)。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）的挑战，影响其在实际部署中的可靠性。现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出FedSDWC方法，通过建模不变特征和可变特征之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，结合因果推断思想处理联邦学习中的数据分布差异问题。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能，相比次优基线FedICON，在CIFAR-10上平均提升3.04%，在CIFAR-100上平均提升8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC通过整合不变和可变特征的因果推断方法，显著提升了联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测能力，为解决数据分布差异问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

Conclusion: 该方法为更广泛应用中可证明高效的交互式偏好获取提供了潜力。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Conclusion: 通过学习可定制的距离度量，显著提升了聚类算法的性能，能够更好地处理分类属性和混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Motivation: 当前VLM生成的标签存在质量低（标签噪声）和缺乏错误修正机制的双重限制，需要一种既能提升标签质量又能控制人工成本的方法。

Method: 提出HCL设置，仅对VLM不一致的样本进行人工修正；推导风险一致性估计器结合人工修正标签和VLM预测训练分类器；提出条件概率方法估计标签分布。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法实现了优越的分类性能，对标签噪声具有鲁棒性，验证了HCL在实际弱监督场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: HCL方法通过选择性人工修正有效解决了VLM生成标签的质量问题，在保证性能的同时显著降低了人工标注成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习中的二阶优化方法（如LocalNewton、LTDA、FedSophia）在异构数据环境下存在局部预条件器漂移问题，这会严重破坏参数训练的收敛性。

Method: 通过将理想的二阶更新分解为服务器上的参数混合和客户端上的局部参数更新，在服务器端引入局部参数的预条件混合机制。

Result: 理论分析证明在强凸目标函数和单次局部更新场景下具有超线性收敛速率，实验结果显示相比传统方法在测试准确率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合有效缓解了局部预条件器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化在联邦学习中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实系统中的部署增加，理解其脆弱性变得至关重要。虽然RLHF/DPO对齐过程中的数据投毒攻击已有实证研究，但其理论基础仍不清楚。

Method: 将投毒攻击建模为带有线性约束的凸优化问题，推导最小攻击成本的下界和上界，并提出成本最小化后处理方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了RLHF/DPO流程中的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Conclusion: 所提出的链式框架能够有效估计期望极值边界，提供更紧的核特定边界，并在局部不确定性量化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Method: GroupFS是一个完全可微分的框架，在特征图和样本图上强制拉普拉斯平滑，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示。

Result: 在涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的九个基准测试中，GroupFS在聚类任务上始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择出与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择有意义的特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现出色，为高维学习任务提供了更好的噪声减少、泛化能力提升和可解释性增强。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

Conclusion: DFDT通过恢复轨迹片段的可拼接性，有效解决了决策变换器在跨域迁移中的挑战，理论分析表明状态值和策略性能差距与MMD不匹配和OT偏差度量相关，且随着这些度量的减小而缩小。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

TL;DR: FSampler是一种免训练、采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用有限差分预测器从历史去噪信号中推断下一个epsilon，在选定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，同时保持采样器更新规则不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少扩散采样过程中的函数评估次数，从而加速采样过程，同时保持高保真度。

Method: 维护最近真实模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器推断下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测值替代模型调用，包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器、保护窗口、周期性锚点和连续跳过上限等机制。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2上，FSampler将时间减少8-22%，模型调用减少15-25%，同时保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。使用激进自适应门时，模型调用可减少45-50%，但保真度较低（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，与多种采样器兼容，无需改变采样器公式，在保持高保真度的同时显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Motivation: 当前AI文本检测器的训练和评估依赖于高质量的基准数据集，但现有数据集如DetectRL存在质量问题，其中98.5%的Claude-LLM数据包含简单的AI生成模式，这些模式可能被检测器作为捷径利用，导致易受欺骗攻击。

Conclusion: 数据清洗是提高AI文本检测器鲁棒性的有效方法，能够减少检测器对简单模式的依赖，使其更难被欺骗攻击绕过。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: We present a stochastic version of the mean-shift clustering algorithm. In this stochastic version a randomly chosen sequence of data points move according to partial gradient ascent steps of the objective function. Theoretical results illustrating the convergence of the proposed approach, and its relative performances is evaluated on synthesized 2-dimensional samples generated by a Gaussian mixture distribution and compared with state-of-the-art methods. It can be observed that in most cases the stochastic mean-shift clustering outperforms the standard mean-shift. We also illustrate as a practical application the use of the presented method for speaker clustering.

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架在未知聚类数量场景下优于现有的聚类方法。

Conclusion: SCMax框架提供了一种有效的完全无参数聚类解决方案，通过自监督共识最大化自动确定最佳聚类结构。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为双面攻击(DFA)的新型联邦学习威胁模型，能够同时降低模型预测准确性和群体公平性，并开发了GuardFed防御框架来应对这种攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但容易受到攻击。现有研究主要关注针对单一目标（效用或公平性）的攻击，而同时破坏两者的攻击策略尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了两种DFA变体：同步DFA(S-DFA)和分离DFA(Sp-DFA)，分别对应不同的现实世界共谋场景。同时设计了GuardFed防御框架，使用少量干净的服务器数据和合成样本维护公平感知参考模型，通过计算双视角信任分数来选择性聚合客户端更新。

Result: 实验表明现有鲁棒联邦学习防御方法无法有效抵抗DFA攻击，而GuardFed在各种非独立同分布和对抗条件下都能保持准确性和公平性，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFA攻击对联邦学习构成严重威胁，而GuardFed提供了一种有效的防御解决方案，能够同时保护模型效用和公平性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

TL;DR: MARBLE模型在传统多臂赌博机问题中引入了潜在马尔可夫状态来处理非平稳环境，提出了马尔可夫平均可索引性准则，并证明了同步Q学习与Whittle索引在未观测到状态切换时仍能收敛到最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多臂赌博机模型假设固定动态，这在非平稳环境中往往不成立。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够适应环境变化的模型和算法。

Method: 提出了MARBLE模型，为多臂赌博机添加了潜在马尔可夫状态；引入了马尔可夫平均可索引性准则；开发了同步Q学习与Whittle索引算法。

Result: 在数字孪生推荐系统上的验证表明，QWI算法能够持续适应变化的潜在状态并收敛到最优策略，实证支持了理论发现。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型和QWI算法为处理非平稳环境中的多臂赌博机问题提供了有效的解决方案，即使在未观测到状态切换的情况下也能保证收敛性。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Method: 提出AdaCuRL框架，集成粗到细难度估计与自适应课程调度，动态对齐数据难度与模型能力，包含数据重访机制缓解灾难性遗忘，采用自适应参考和稀疏KL策略防止策略退化。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，AdaCuRL在LLMs和MLLMs上均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为大语言模型的推理能力提升提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂黑盒AI模型的普及，需要能够解释其决策的技术。特征归因方法已成为提供事后解释的流行解决方案，但该领域历来缺乏正式的问题定义。

Method: 提出了分布特征归因解释（DFAX），这是一种新颖的模型无关特征归因方法。DFAX是第一个直接基于数据分布解释分类器预测的特征归因方法。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，DFAX比最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: DFAX克服了现有方法的局限性，为特征归因问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WOODELF是一个新的SHAP算法，通过将决策树、博弈论和布尔逻辑整合到统一框架中，实现了线性时间计算背景SHAP值，在CPU和GPU上都能高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法存在效率问题，特别是在处理大规模数据集时计算时间过长，需要一种更高效的算法来支持实际应用中的大规模计算需求。

Method: WOODELF为每个消费者构建一个伪布尔公式，捕捉特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用这种表示在线性时间内计算背景SHAP值。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有背景Shapley值仅需162秒，在GPU上仅需16秒，相比现有最佳方法分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一个高效、可扩展的SHAP计算框架，支持多种博弈论值的计算，能够显著提升大规模SHAP计算的性能。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的PET成像需要支持非约束探测器布局的方法，从步行通过设计到长轴环，其中间隙和开放侧会导致严重欠采样的正弦图。与其约束硬件形成完整圆柱体，不如将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验。

Method: 探索使用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的正弦图，将数据驱动方法特别是生成模型作为恢复缺失信息的途径。

Result: 该方法为新型、成本效益高且患者友好的PET几何结构在真实临床环境中的应用提供了可能。

Conclusion: 通过将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验，并使用条件扩散模型进行插值，可以支持非约束探测器布局，推动PET成像技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CREAT的约束强化学习驱动的配置文件污染攻击方法，通过双层次优化框架和多奖励强化学习来平衡攻击效果和隐蔽性，解决了现有PPA方法在细粒度扰动和分布偏移检测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的序列推荐系统容易受到对抗攻击，但传统的数据投毒攻击需要大规模用户访问或虚假配置文件，缺乏实用性。配置文件污染攻击(PPA)虽然能通过污染部分用户交互来诱导目标误预测，但存在两个主要限制：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了项目转换的细粒度扰动，以及整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移。

Method: 提出CREAT方法，结合双层次优化框架和多奖励强化学习：1) 开发模式平衡奖励策略，整合模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励；2) 采用约束组相对强化学习范式，通过动态障碍约束和组共享经验回放实现逐步扰动。

Result: 大量实验证明了CREAT的有效性，能够在实现目标污染的同时保持最低的可检测性。

Conclusion: CREAT方法通过约束强化学习成功解决了PPA攻击中的细粒度扰动和隐蔽性问题，为序列推荐系统的安全性研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

Motivation: 训练数据扰动（如对抗性数据投毒、机器遗忘、差分隐私）的认证技术相对未被充分探索，而推理时数据扰动的认证已有深入研究。

Method: 通过边界可到达参数集（建立可证明的参数空间边界），AGT为通过一阶优化方法训练的模型行为分析提供了形式化方法。

Conclusion: AGT框架填补了训练数据扰动认证领域的空白，为对抗性数据投毒、机器遗忘和差分隐私等关键场景提供了形式化认证方法。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规要求完全遗忘未经授权的数据，但现有时空图模型在遗忘单个节点时需要几乎等同于完整模型重新训练的成本，因此需要有效的时空图遗忘方法。

Method: 提出CallosumNet框架，包含两个关键技术：(1)增强子图构建(ESC)，基于生物启发的虚拟神经节等因素自适应构建多个局部子图；(2)全局神经节桥接(GGB)，从局部子图中重建全局时空依赖关系。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，CallosumNet仅产生1%-2%的相对MAE损失，显著优于现有基线方法。消融研究验证了两个提出技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CallosumNet能够高效实现完整的时空图遗忘，满足隐私法规要求，同时保持接近黄金模型的性能。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业物联网环境中现有遗忘学习方法依赖保留数据带来的计算负担、能耗问题以及与工业数据孤岛和隐私合规要求的冲突。

Method: PTE框架将遗忘学习构建为探测-编辑过程：首先通过梯度上升探测模型在待遗忘类别决策边界邻域，生成编辑指令；然后进行推-拉协同优化，推分支主动拆解目标类别决策区域，拉分支应用掩码知识蒸馏锚定保留类别知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTE在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: PTE框架仅使用待遗忘数据和原始模型即可实现高效平衡的知识编辑，为动态工业物联网环境中的选择性知识遗忘提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Motivation: 传统语义GP依赖固定语法变换，TSGP旨在学习能产生相似语义的多样化结构变异，提升符号回归性能。

Method: 使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过目标语义距离SD_t控制语义空间中的步长，平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在24个数据集上显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，平均排名1.58，且比SLIM_GSGP产生更紧凑的解。

Conclusion: TSGP能跨维度泛化符号回归问题，SD_t提供有效的探索-利用平衡机制，小值SD_t持续改进适应度但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

TL;DR: SOLIS方法通过监督对比学习构建评估对齐的嵌入空间，在该空间中结果相似性由邻近度表示，单个全局优势向量从输到赢区域定向空间，候选动作根据与该方向的对齐度进行排序，将规划简化为潜在空间中的向量操作。

Motivation: 研究是否可以直接在评估对齐的嵌入空间中进行规划，而不是训练策略或价值头，探索轻量级替代传统动态模型或策略学习的方法。

Method: 使用监督对比学习学习评估对齐的嵌入空间，在该空间中捕获结果相似性并通过单个全局优势向量定向空间，将候选动作根据与优势方向的对齐度排序，将规划简化为潜在空间中的向量操作。

Result: 在国际象棋中，SOLIS仅使用浅层搜索和学习的嵌入指导就能在受限条件下达到竞争性强度。

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

TL;DR: AutoSynth是一个自动化工作流发现和优化框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和无需参考数据集的混合奖励机制，解决了监督微调中合成数据生成的冷启动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业任务中高质量数据集手动标注成本高昂的问题，以及现有自动化方法需要标记数据集进行奖励建模的冷启动问题，特别是在没有客观真实答案的主观开放式任务中。

Method: 将问题重构为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用新型无数据集混合奖励指导搜索。该奖励通过两个LLM作为评判者组件实现元学习：一个使用动态生成的任务特定指标评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务实验中，AutoSynth生成数据训练的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs 2-5%），在某些指标上匹配或超过专家设计的工作流，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟（减少90%以上）。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、成本效益高的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Conclusion: 所提出的二阶确定性演员-评论家框架能够有效利用曲率信息，在保持通用性的同时显著提升收敛速度。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenePheno是首个可解释的多标签预测框架，能够直接从基因序列预测基因敲除诱导的表型异常，通过对比学习和生物学一致性约束实现多表型关联建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注特定基因变异对有限表型的影响，或依赖人工整理的遗传信息，难以从基因序列直接广泛预测多种表型异常。基因序列与表型之间的模态差距和多效性关系使这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: 采用对比多标签学习目标捕捉表型间相关性，结合排他性正则化确保生物学一致性，并引入基因功能瓶颈层提供可解释的功能机制概念。

Result: 在四个数据集上，GenePheno在基因中心Fmax和表型中心AUC指标上达到最先进水平，案例研究证明其能够揭示基因功能机制。

Conclusion: GenePheno为直接从基因序列预测基因敲除诱导的多表型异常提供了首个可解释框架，在准确性和可解释性方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

TL;DR: 本文提出ST-CLIP模型，将时空信息整合到视觉语言模型中，用于交通场景理解任务。该方法基于CLIP模型，设计了时空上下文感知的多方面提示学习方法，在少样本学习策略下在复杂场景理解中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将交通场景理解视为普通图像理解任务，忽略了时空信息以及交通场景不同方面之间的相互关系。导航和共享出行应用收集了大量带有时空数据的图像，需要综合考虑时空和视觉文本数据的依赖关系。

Method: 基于CLIP模型设计时空上下文感知的多方面提示学习方法(SCAMP)，包括动态时空上下文表示模块和双层时空感知多方面提示学习模块，将时空上下文表示向量整合到CLIP模型的提示词嵌入中。

Result: 在两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法在复杂场景理解场景中具有优越性能，特别是在少样本学习策略下。

Conclusion: 这是首次将时空信息整合到视觉语言模型中以促进交通场景理解任务的尝试，证明了时空信息对交通场景理解的重要性。

Abstract: Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端的音频描述生成系统MCAD，专门针对足球比赛内容，无需依赖真实音频描述标注，通过多模态上下文线索和微调的视频大语言模型生成完整的音频描述文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频描述自动化方法主要局限于高质量电影内容且依赖人工标注的真实音频描述，需要扩展音频描述生成到体育领域（特别是足球比赛），并解决领域特定数据集的缺乏问题。

Method: 在公开的电影音频描述数据集上微调视频大语言模型，使其学习音频描述的叙事结构和惯例；在推理时整合多模态上下文线索（球员身份、足球事件和动作、比赛解说），结合输入提示生成每个视频片段的完整音频描述文本。

Result: 开发了新的评估指标ARGE-AD，用于准确评估生成音频描述的质量，该指标评估五个特征：使用人名、提及动作和事件、适当的描述长度、避免使用代词、与解说或字幕的重叠度。在两个领域（电影和足球）上进行了深入分析。

Conclusion: MCAD系统成功将音频描述生成扩展到足球领域，无需真实音频描述标注，并提出了有效的评估指标ARGE-AD，同时贡献了100个足球比赛片段的专家标注音频描述数据。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序来解决问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多不熟悉编程语言的人需要与代码交互，需要一种方法让非专业人士也能使用ASP解决组合逻辑问题。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后从简化语言解析AMR图，系统性地生成ASP约束。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，相比完全依赖LLM的方法，该系统最小化了LLM的作用。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重大第一步。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育场景中从答案提供者转向智能导师，但现有监督微调方法只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力。强化学习方法面临两个关键挑战：无法区分学生是否真正理解还是简单重复答案，以及无法实时感知学生认知状态变化。

Method: UCO方法采用多轮交互式强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进步奖励捕捉学生认知进步，评估学生是否真正从困惑转向理解；支架奖励动态识别每个学生的最近发展区，鼓励教师在该区域内保持有效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，并达到与先进闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过创新的奖励机制有效解决了LLM作为智能导师时的动态适应问题，在数学教育场景中表现出色，为AI教育应用提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

TL;DR: AlphaCast是一个人类智慧与大型语言模型智能协同推理的框架，将时间序列预测重新定义为交互式过程，通过分阶段协作实现预测准备、生成和验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：自动化预测准备阶段构建多源认知基础；生成推理和反射优化阶段整合统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环进行持续自校正。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出通过构建多智能体管道实现渐进式、增量式、顺序式(GIS)搜索来增强LLM推理能力，并通过递归精炼方法验证了复杂模型在推理质量上的显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型展现出卓越的流畅性，但研究人员仍在努力从中提取更强的推理能力。基于对LLM计算的搜索式理解，本文旨在建立一个系统框架来理解LLM推理和优化。

Method: 采用递归精炼(RR)方法，包括自我批评、对抗性压力测试和整合关键反馈的迭代过程，作为实现GIS搜索的实用方法。设计了简单线性管道与复杂结构化管道的对比实验，构建反映美国开国元勋历史人物的多智能体模型。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中始终优于简单模型，平均仲裁分数为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和战略框架方面更优越。

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理能力的强大架构特征，高质量推理是受控的增量搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在公共道路上部署时会面临各种驾驶危险，需要具备持续监控和自适应响应的韧性能力来维持复杂场景下的稳健驾驶行为。

Method: 开发了Argus框架，持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。

Result: 与三种最先进的端到端ADS集成评估显示，Argus有效提升了系统韧性，平均驾驶分数提升达150.30%，防止了64.38%的违规，且时间开销很小。

Conclusion: Argus框架能够高效增强自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著提升驾驶性能并预防安全违规，为复杂驾驶场景下的安全运行提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化的两阶段设计，仅需1/10的数据量就能达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，超越了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的优化建模方法需要大量标注或合成数据，导致成本高昂且可扩展性受限，因此需要开发数据效率更高的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先使用监督微调从有限标注数据中学习问题建模和代码生成的推理模式，然后通过测试时组相对策略优化提升能力和一致性，充分利用稀缺标注数据和丰富无标注数据。

Result: OR-R1仅需1/10的合成数据就能达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，比ORLM高出4.2%，在仅100个合成样本的情况下仍能超越ORLM 2.4%。TGRPO额外贡献3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升，将单次尝试与多次尝试性能差距从13%缩小到7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹学优化问题建模和求解提供了稳健、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，显著降低了工业应用中的专业知识和数据壁垒。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的方法，通过新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)来解决大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在减少响应长度的同时提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型如DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI o1经常生成冗长的响应，包含冗余或不相关的推理步骤（过度思考现象），这显著增加了计算成本。现有方法在奖励函数中加入长度惩罚，但经常出现长度崩溃和训练崩溃问题。

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型(CRM)的流程，用于对推理路径的简洁性进行评分；引入新颖的简洁性奖励函数(CRF)，在结果奖励和简洁性评分之间建立显式依赖关系。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Qwen2.5-7B上实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应令牌长度减少；该方法在Llama和Mistral等其他LLM上也具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的CRM和CRF方法能够有效解决大型推理模型中的过度思考问题，在提高推理效果的同时显著降低计算成本，具有理论优越性和实际有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

TL;DR: 提出了MedFuse框架，通过乘法融合模块处理不规则临床时间序列数据，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床时间序列数据具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等特点。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse（乘法嵌入融合）模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症监护和慢性护理的三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可推广的方法，乘法融合机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和残差分量，有效解决了交通预测中的关键挑战，为智能交通系统提供了更准确的预测能力。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Result: 在三个实验（合成2D高斯玩具问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集）中，该方法能够访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示提供了一个简单而强大的机制，为使用生成模型进行科学探索提供了途径，特别是针对那些未被捕获、考虑或编目的信息。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

*Peiyu Li,Xiaobao Huang,Nitesh V. Chawla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向实际操作，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实创意领域中的程序能力，揭示表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行进行功能评估。基准涵盖针法分类、指令接地、自然语言到DSL转换和图像到DSL转换等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，模型性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成方面的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，突出了在真实创意领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的显著差距，代码已开源。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模型聚合的AI安全方法，通过共识采样算法从k个模型中选择最安全的s个子集，在模型间达成足够共识时输出结果，否则弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法主要依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险无法仅通过检查检测。需要一种架构无关的补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 使用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成充分共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法受Vyas等人(2023)的可证明版权保护算法启发。

Result: 该方法能够实现与k个模型中最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，并在安全模型足够多且共识充分时限制弃权概率。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的、模型无关的AI安全方法，通过从模型集合中的未知安全子集放大安全保证，构建单一可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

TL;DR: 本文从科学和系统视角阐述了物理人工智能的基本原理，旨在为智能系统的物理体现、感知、行动、学习和情境敏感性建立统一的理论框架，将智能视为身体、环境和经验之间真实互动的涌现现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而Physical AI将智能理解为身体、环境和经验之间真实互动的涌现现象，需要建立新的理论基础来描述物理智能系统的本质特征。

Method: 提出了六个基本原理：体现、感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原理构成一个封闭的控制循环，能量、信息、控制和情境在其中持续互动。

Result: 理论模型表明这六个原理不是松散的功能模块，而是构成一个封闭控制循环，使系统能够从物理经验而非数据库中生成意义，实现了智能作为物理体现过程的范式转变。

Conclusion: 物理人工智能将学习理解为智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，而非参数调整。通过康复机器人案例展示了物理智能来源于即时、体现的经验，而非抽象计算。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

TL;DR: GIRAM是一个用于持续下一个兴趣点推荐的模型无关框架，通过整合上下文感知的持续兴趣和近期兴趣，解决现有方法无法适应用户行为变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有下一个兴趣点推荐方法依赖静态数据集和固定模型，无法适应随时间变化的用户行为，需要能够持续更新以适应演化用户兴趣的解决方案。

Method: GIRAM框架包含四个组件：兴趣记忆库、上下文感知键编码模块、生成式键检索模块、自适应兴趣更新融合模块，可无缝集成到现有推荐模型中。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，GIRAM持续优于最先进方法，同时在更新时间和内存消耗方面保持高效率。

Conclusion: GIRAM通过有效整合持续兴趣和近期兴趣，为持续下一个兴趣点推荐提供了高效且模型无关的解决方案，能够适应不断变化的用户行为。

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.

TL;DR: NeuroCLIP是一个针对EEG-图像对比学习的提示调优框架，通过双流视觉嵌入、视觉提示令牌和神经科学启发的对比损失，显著提升了脑电信号与视觉语义的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将CLIP视为静态特征提取器，忽视了其对神经表征的适应性以及EEG-图像对齐中存在的生理-符号鸿沟问题。

Method: 1. 双流视觉嵌入管道结合动态滤波和令牌级融合生成实例级自适应提示；2. 首次在EEG-图像对齐中引入视觉提示令牌；3. 提出基于神经科学原理的改进对比损失函数。

Result: 在THINGS-EEG2数据集上，NeuroCLIP在零样本图像检索中达到63.2%的Top-1准确率，比之前最佳方法提升12.3%，并在跨被试条件下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 生理感知的提示调优方法在桥接脑信号和视觉语义方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality- level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏成熟的用户模拟验证方法和基准，难以评估模拟器是否准确反映真实用户行为，因此需要建立标准化的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含160个真实搜索会话的数据集，其中70个会话提供最多62次模拟器运行，分为任务A和任务B，分别预测用户下一搜索查询和话语。

Result: 开发了首个公开可用的基准套件，将真实搜索会话与模拟下一查询预测联系起来，并引入了新的下一查询预测评估指标。

Conclusion: Sim4IA-Bench为评估和比较用户模拟方法提供了基础，促进了可重复研究，并推动了信息访问中现实和可解释用户模拟的进一步发展。

Abstract: Validating user simulation is a difficult task due to the lack of established measures and benchmarks, which makes it challenging to assess whether a simulator accurately reflects real user behavior. As part of the Sim4IA Micro-Shared Task at the Sim4IA Workshop, SIGIR 2025, we present Sim4IA-Bench, a simulation benchmark suit for the prediction of the next queries and utterances, the first of its kind in the IR com- munity. Our dataset as part of the suite comprises 160 real-world search sessions from the CORE search engine. For 70 of these sessions, up to 62 simulator runs are available, divided into Task A and Task B, in which different approaches predicted users next search queries or utterances. Sim4IA-Bench provides a basis for evaluating and comparing user simu- lation approaches and for developing new measures of simulator validity. Although modest in size, the suite represents the first publicly available benchmark that links real search sessions with simulated next-query pre- dictions. In addition to serving as a testbed for next query prediction, it also enables exploratory studies on query reformulation behavior, intent drift, and interaction-aware retrieval evaluation. We also introduce a new measure for evaluating next-query predictions in this task. By making the suite publicly available, we aim to promote reproducible research and stimulate further work on realistic and explainable user simulation for information access: https://github.com/irgroup/Sim4IA-Bench.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'前瞻控制'的新框架，将PAC学习扩展到非平稳环境中的学习和控制问题，证明了经验风险最小化(ERM)在特定条件下渐近达到贝叶斯最优策略，并在觅食任务中展示了该方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI在最优控制问题上的方法主要基于强化学习或在线学习，但这些框架与PAC学习在数学上存在差异。为了将PAC学习的优势扩展到控制领域，特别是在非平稳环境中，需要开发新的学习框架。

Method: 基于前瞻学习理论，提出了'前瞻控制'框架，将PAC学习扩展到包含控制的非平稳环境。使用经验风险最小化(ERM)方法，并在觅食任务这一典型移动智能体任务中进行具体实现。

Result: 理论证明在相当一般的假设下，ERM能够渐近达到贝叶斯最优策略。在觅食任务实验中，现有强化学习算法在非平稳环境中学习失败，即使经过修改，效率也比前瞻觅食智能体低几个数量级。

Conclusion: 前瞻控制框架成功地将PAC学习扩展到非平稳环境中的控制问题，在理论和实验上都显示出优于传统强化学习方法的性能，为AI在动态环境中的最优控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimal control of the future is the next frontier for AI. Current approaches to this problem are typically rooted in either reinforcement learning or online learning. While powerful, these frameworks for learning are mathematically distinct from Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, which has been the workhorse for the recent technological achievements in AI. We therefore build on the prior work of prospective learning, an extension of PAC learning (without control) in non-stationary environments (De Silva et al., 2023; Silva et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2026). Here, we further extend the PAC learning framework to address learning and control in non-stationary environments. Using this framework, called ''Prospective Control'', we prove that under certain fairly general assumptions, empirical risk minimization (ERM) asymptotically achieves the Bayes optimal policy. We then consider a specific instance of prospective control, foraging, which is a canonical task for any mobile agent, be it natural or artificial. We illustrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn in these non-stationary environments, and even with modifications, they are orders of magnitude less efficient than our prospective foraging agents. Code is available at: https://github.com/neurodata/ProspectiveLearningwithControl.

Result: 添加噪声（即使是少量）会对模型性能产生显著影响。

Conclusion: 噪声对BCOPS算法的性能有重要影响，需要在实践中考虑训练数据质量。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of adding noise to the training set classes in classification tasks using the BCOPS algorithm (Balanced and Conformal Optimized Prediction Sets), proposed by Guan & Tibshirani (2022). The BCOPS algorithm is an application of conformal prediction combined with a machine learning method to construct prediction sets such that the probability of the true class being included in the prediction set for a test observation meets a specified coverage guarantee. An observation is considered an outlier if its true class is not present in the training set. The study employs both synthetic and real datasets and conducts experiments to evaluate the prediction abstention rate for outlier observations and the model's robustness in this previously untested scenario. The results indicate that the addition of noise, even in small amounts, can have a significant effect on model performance.

Conclusion: 提出的稳健采样策略为主动统计推断提供了可靠保障，确保估计性能不会劣于基准方法，并在条件合适时获得显著提升。

Abstract: Active statistical inference is a new method for inference with AI-assisted data collection. Given a budget on the number of labeled data points that can be collected and assuming access to an AI predictive model, the basic idea is to improve estimation accuracy by prioritizing the collection of labels where the model is most uncertain. The drawback, however, is that inaccurate uncertainty estimates can make active sampling produce highly noisy results, potentially worse than those from naive uniform sampling. In this work, we present robust sampling strategies for active statistical inference. Robust sampling ensures that the resulting estimator is never worse than the estimator using uniform sampling. Furthermore, with reliable uncertainty estimates, the estimator usually outperforms standard active inference. This is achieved by optimally interpolating between uniform and active sampling, depending on the quality of the uncertainty scores, and by using ideas from robust optimization. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a series of real datasets from computational social science and survey research.

Abstract: Self-consuming generative models have received significant attention over the last few years. In this paper, we study a self-consuming generative model with heterogeneous preferences that is a generalization of the model in Ferbach et al. (2024). The model is retrained round by round using real data and its previous-round synthetic outputs. The asymptotic behavior of the retraining dynamics is investigated across four regimes using different techniques including the nonlinear Perron--Frobenius theory. Our analyses improve upon that of Ferbach et al. (2024) and provide convergence results in settings where the well-known Banach contraction mapping arguments do not apply. Stability and non-stability results regarding the retraining dynamics are also given.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching approaches to generative modeling have shown promise in domains where the state space is continuous, such as image generation or protein folding & design, and discrete, exemplified by diffusion large language models. They offer a natural fit when the number of elements in a state is fixed in advance (e.g. images), but require ad hoc solutions when, for example, the length of a response from a large language model, or the number of amino acids in a protein chain is not known a priori.
  Here we propose Branching Flows, a generative modeling framework that, like diffusion and flow matching approaches, transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. But in Branching Flows, the elements in the state evolve over a forest of binary trees, branching and dying stochastically with rates that are learned by the model. This allows the model to control, during generation, the number of elements in the sequence. We also show that Branching Flows can compose with any flow matching base process on discrete sets, continuous Euclidean spaces, smooth manifolds, and `multimodal' product spaces that mix these components. We demonstrate this in three domains: small molecule generation (multimodal), antibody sequence generation (discrete), and protein backbone generation (multimodal), and show that Branching Flows is a capable distribution learner with a stable learning objective, and that it enables new capabilities.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task in modern data science. Several projection methods specifically tailored to take into account the non-linearity of the data via local embeddings have been proposed. Such methods are often based on local neighbourhood structures and require tuning the number of neighbours that define this local structure, and the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional space onto which the data are projected. Such choices critically influence the quality of the resulting embedding. In this paper, we exploit a recently proposed intrinsic dimension estimator which also returns the optimal locally adaptive neighbourhood sizes according to some desirable criteria. In principle, this adaptive framework can be employed to perform an optimal hyper-parameter tuning of any dimensionality reduction algorithm that relies on local neighbourhood structures. Numerical experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets show that the proposed method can be used to significantly improve well-known projection methods when employed for various learning tasks, with improvements measurable through both quantitative metrics and the quality of low-dimensional visualizations.

Conclusion: 所提出的通用分布去噪器在仅知道噪声水平的情况下，能够有效恢复原始信号分布，通过最优输运理论实现了比传统方法更优的分布恢复性能，且可通过分数匹配高效实现。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + σZ$, where $σ\in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(σ^4)$ and $O(σ^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Ampère equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + σ^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{σ^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{σ^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]
