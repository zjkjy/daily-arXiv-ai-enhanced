### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是一个针对印度次大陆的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、MMT和VQA三个任务，共约5K图像和37K+问答对，评估了8个模型在文化多样性环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）的评估基准大多以西方为中心，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的评估，因此需要建立一个针对印度次大陆的基准测试来分析模型在多元文化背景下的表现。

Method: 创建IndicVisionBench基准，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含OCR、多模态机器翻译和视觉问答三个多模态任务，覆盖13个文化相关主题，并发布10种印度语言的并行标注语料库。

Result: 评估了8个模型（包括专有闭源系统和开源模型），发现当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著的性能差距，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench通过关注文化多样性和多语言性，建立了一个可复现的评估框架，为更包容的多模态研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [GSE: Evaluating Sticker Visual Semantic Similarity via a General Sticker Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04977)
*Heng Er Metilda Chee,Jiayin Wang,Zhiqiang Guo,Weizhi Ma,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了表情包语义相似性任务，创建了首个基准数据集Triple-S，并开发了通用表情包编码器GSE来解决现有模型在处理表情包语义时的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表情包已成为流行的视觉交流形式，但由于其内容高度多样化和符号化，理解表情包的语义关系仍然具有挑战性。现有预训练视觉和多模态模型难以捕捉细微的表情包语义。

Method: 正式定义了表情包语义相似性任务，构建了包含905个人工标注正负样本对的Triple-S基准数据集，提出了轻量级通用表情包编码器GSE，使用Triple-S和额外数据集学习鲁棒的表情包嵌入表示。

Result: GSE在未见过的表情包上表现出优越性能，在情感分类和表情包检索等下游任务中取得强劲结果。Triple-S基准和GSE模型已公开发布。

Conclusion: 通过发布Triple-S和GSE，为表情包理解、检索和多模态内容生成的未来研究提供了标准化评估工具和鲁棒嵌入表示。

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为条件偏好优化（CPO）的新方法，通过直接优化控制条件而非生成图像来提升文本到图像生成的精确控制能力，相比现有方法在多个控制类型上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++在优化控制信号时存在限制：只优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入近似误差。而直接偏好优化（DPO）方法由于生成模型的不确定性，难以确保图像对仅在可控性上存在差异。

Method: 提出条件偏好优化（CPO）方法，通过构建获胜和失败的控制信号（c^w和c^l），训练模型偏好c^w。这种方法消除了混杂因素，提供了低方差的训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，CPO在多个控制类型上显著优于最先进的ControlNet++：分割任务错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态任务降低70-80%，边缘和深度图一致降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO方法在理论上比DPO具有更低的对比损失方差，在实际应用中取得了更好的结果，同时需要更少的计算和存储资源用于数据集构建。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for filmmaking challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05152)
*Adrian Azzarelli,Nantheera Anantrasirichai,David R Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将可变形高斯泼溅技术的前景和背景分离的方法，通过稀疏掩码在稀疏相机配置下实现高质量动态3D重建，在模型尺寸减半的情况下PSNR提升高达3分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电影制作中因预算限制导致的稀疏相机配置问题，现有方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时效果受限。

Method: 使用t=0时刻的稀疏掩码将规范高斯和变形场分为前景和背景组件，分别用不同损失函数训练，前景学习颜色、位置和旋转变化，背景仅学习位置变化。

Result: 在3D和2.5D娱乐数据集上实现了SotA的定性和定量结果，模型尺寸减半时PSNR提升高达3分，并能生成包括透明和动态纹理的分割动态重建。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下有效提升了动态3D重建质量，无需密集掩码监督即可生成分割的动态重建结果。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

### [6] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了3D高斯点编码器，这是一种基于学习到的3D高斯混合的显式逐点嵌入方法，相比传统的隐式表示（如PointNet）在速度和参数效率方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D识别任务中，从隐式表示（如PointNet）转向显式几何表示，类似于3D重建领域从NeRF转向高斯溅射的趋势，旨在提高计算效率。

Method: 开发了基于自然梯度和从PointNet蒸馏的优化技术，学习能够重建PointNet激活的高斯基。还扩展了3D高斯溅射的滤波技术来加速编码器。

Result: 3D高斯点编码器比传统PointNet运行快2.7倍，内存减少46%，FLOPs减少88%。在Mamba3D中运行快1.27倍，内存和FLOPs分别减少42%和54%。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器是一种轻量级且高效的3D表示方法，能够在仅CPU设备上实现高帧率，为3D识别任务提供了更优的计算效率。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [7] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过Cellpose案例研究，系统分析了生物医学图像分割中的数据冗余和跨域迁移问题。研究发现仅需10%数据即可达到饱和性能，并提出数据集量化策略构建紧凑训练子集。跨域微调会导致灾难性遗忘，但选择性重放5-10%源数据可有效恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用生物医学图像分割模型面临两个关键挑战：训练数据冗余程度未知，以及跨域迁移对模型保留能力的影响。这些问题在现有研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用数据集量化策略构建紧凑训练子集，通过MAE嵌入和t-SNE进行潜在空间分析。进行跨域微调实验，使用选择性重放策略恢复源域性能，并研究训练域排序对泛化的影响。

Result: 实验显示图像分割性能在仅使用10%数据时达到饱和，表明存在大量冗余。跨域微调导致源域性能显著下降，但选择性重放5-10%源数据可有效恢复性能。训练域排序能改善泛化并减少遗忘。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割的高效训练不仅需要紧凑数据子集，还需要保留感知的学习策略和明智的域排序。数据为中心的设计对于模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [8] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合主动学习和伪标记的数据中心化AI工作流，将大型基础模型与nnU-Net相结合，显著减少生物医学图像分割中的人工标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在噪声数据上表现不佳，nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证，而大型基础模型在特定数据集上可能表现不足。需要一种减少人工干预的解决方案。

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标签用于nnU-Net自配置，然后通过主动学习选择代表性核心集进行最小化人工标注，最后微调nnU-Net模型。

Result: 该方法显著减少了手动标注需求，同时保持了有竞争力的分割性能。

Conclusion: 为生物医学研究人员提供了一个可访问的解决方案，能够在分割任务中应用最先进的AI技术。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪效果，通过标签向量集嵌入自然分割过程。

Method: 基于标签向量集的法向量相似性进行分割，使用总变差正则化，采用分裂Bregman（ADMM）方法求解优化问题，顶点更新基于二阶形状计算。

Result: 提出了一种结合几何去噪和分割的新方法框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何去噪提供了一种结合先验知识和分割的新范式，具有理论创新性。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种隐式自先验方法，通过从输入点云本身提取形状特定的先验，并将其嵌入隐式神经表示中，无需外部训练数据即可恢复高质量表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不规则点云恢复高质量表面是病态问题，除非有强几何先验。现有方法依赖外部训练数据，而本文直接从输入点云本身提取先验。

Method: 联合训练可学习嵌入字典与隐式距离场，通过交叉注意力机制捕获形状的重复结构和长程相关性。使用自监督点云重建损失优化，然后采样提取密集点和法向量，结合稳健隐式移动最小二乘法。

Result: 实验表明该方法在生成高保真表面方面优于经典和基于学习的方法，具有更好的细节保持和对常见数据退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种混合策略既能保持输入数据的精细几何细节，又能利用学习到的先验来正则化稀疏区域，实现了无需外部训练数据的高质量表面重建。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据在多站点采集时的标准化问题，克服了传统ComBAT方法在临床应用中存在的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DW-MRI数据在多站点采集时存在扫描仪特异性偏差，传统ComBAT方法依赖线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量等假设，限制了其在临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出Clinical-ComBAT方法，包括：独立站点标准化、非线性多项式数据模型、基于规范站点的站点特定标准化、适用于小队列的方差先验、超参数调优和拟合优度评估指标。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，显示扩散指标对齐得到改善，规范建模的适用性增强。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT为现实临床场景提供了灵活有效的多站点DW-MRI数据标准化解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future
research in AI dentistry.

*Tharindu Fernando,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习(MAARL)的新型深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，以解决深度伪造检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速发展导致深度伪造越来越逼真，给执法和公众信任带来挑战。现有的被动深度伪造检测器难以跟上步伐，而主动水印方法在平衡对良性失真的鲁棒性和对恶意篡改的敏感性方面存在困难。

Method: 开发了一种在潜在空间中操作的可学习水印嵌入器，利用高维潜在空间表示捕获高级图像语义，同时提供对消息编码和提取的精确控制。采用MAARL范式，使可学习水印智能体通过与对抗攻击智能体模拟的良性及恶意图像操作动态课程交互，追求鲁棒性与脆弱性之间的最优平衡。

Result: 在CelebA和CelebA-HQ基准上的综合评估表明，该方法始终优于最先进的方法，在具有挑战性的操作场景下，在CelebA上实现了超过4.5%的改进，在CelebA-HQ上实现了超过5.3%的改进。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的基于高维潜在空间和MAARL的水印框架能够有效解决深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性与敏感性平衡问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under

TL;DR: CLM系统通过将高斯分布数据卸载到CPU内存，仅在需要时加载到GPU内存，使3D高斯溅射(3DGS)能够在单个消费级GPU上渲染大型场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在渲染大型或复杂场景时面临GPU内存不足的挑战，因为其内存需求超过了大多数GPU的容量。

Method: 利用3DGS内存访问模式的观察，采用流水线化的卸载策略，重叠GPU-CPU通信、GPU计算和CPU计算，同时减少通信量。

Result: 在单个RTX4090上成功渲染需要1亿个高斯分布的大型场景，并达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统有效解决了3DGS在大场景渲染中的内存限制问题，实现了在消费级硬件上的高效运行。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种简单有效的方法，通过整合平均池化视觉特征来改进文本嵌入，以解决LVLM架构中语言模态偏差问题，显著减少幻觉并改善视觉定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现主流LVLM架构存在对语言模态的内在偏差，这主要源于将视觉嵌入简单附加到输入文本序列的常见做法，导致幻觉问题。

Method: 提出通过整合平均池化视觉特征来改进文本嵌入的方法，这是一种简单、鲁棒且高效的视觉信息融合方式。

Result: 该方法在已建立的基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位，并显著减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化提供了有效的视觉信息融合方式，但更复杂的融合方法可能进一步改善视觉定位和跨模态对齐，这留待未来研究。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

*Jing Jin,Xu Liu,Te Gao,Zhihong Shi,Yixiong Liang,Ruiqing Zheng,Hulin Kuang,Min Zeng,Shichao Kan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态残差编码与幻灯片级对比学习（DRE-SLCL）方法，用于端到端的全切片图像表示学习，解决了GPU内存限制下无法同时处理所有图像块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）表示对于癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测至关重要，但由于标准千兆像素切片包含数万个图像块，在当前GPU限制下难以在单个小批量中计算所有块的梯度。

Method: 使用内存库存储数据集中所有WSI的图块特征，训练时每个小批量包含多个WSI，随机采样部分图块计算特征，同时从内存库中选择同一WSI的额外图块特征，通过残差编码技术结合采样特征和内存库特征生成WSI表示，最后基于小批量内WSI的表示和病理报告计算幻灯片级对比损失。

Result: 在癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测任务上进行的实验证明了所提出的DRE-SLCL方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法通过动态残差编码和幻灯片级对比学习，成功解决了端到端WSI表示学习中的计算挑战，并在多个癌症相关任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

TL;DR: Pressure2Motion是一种从地面压力序列和文本提示生成人体运动的新算法，无需摄像头或可穿戴设备，适用于隐私保护、低光照和低成本场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运动捕捉需要专业设备的问题，为隐私保护、低光照和低成本场景提供解决方案，克服压力信号到全身运动的不确定性挑战。

Method: 使用双级特征提取器解析压力数据，结合分层扩散模型识别运动轨迹和姿态调整，利用压力物理线索和文本语义指导精确运动生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成高保真、物理合理的运动，在该任务上建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是首个同时利用压力数据和语言先验进行运动生成的开创性工作，建立的MPL基准是该任务的第一个基准测试。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: NTP-MRISeg将医学参考图像分割重新构建为基于多模态序列的自回归下一令牌预测任务，通过统一架构简化模型设计，无需复杂模态融合或外部分割模型，并引入三种新策略解决累积误差和边界敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学参考图像分割方法通常需要复杂的多模态融合或多阶段解码器设计，作者希望简化模型架构，实现端到端训练，并利用新兴大规模多模态模型的预训练分词器来提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出NTP-MRISeg框架，将MRIS重新构建为基于图像、文本和掩码标记化表示的统一多模态序列的自回归下一令牌预测任务。引入三种新策略：下一k令牌预测减少累积误差、令牌级对比学习增强边界敏感性和缓解长尾分布、基于记忆的硬错误令牌优化策略。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的广泛实验表明，NTP-MRISeg实现了新的最先进性能，为传统MRIS流程提供了简化和有效的替代方案。

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg通过重新构建MRIS任务为自回归下一令牌预测，简化了模型设计，支持端到端训练，并利用预训练分词器提升性能，为医学图像分割提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP是一个利用多视角角色扮演提示来增强CLIP模型训练数据语义多样性的框架，通过MLLMs生成多样化caption，在保持数据量不变的情况下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和caption冗余浅显，需要解决语义多样性不足的问题。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释者）指导MLLMs从不同视角生成语义多样化的caption，增强图像-文本对齐的细粒度。

Result: 在仅使用100万对Role-SynthCLIP数据训练的CLIP-B/16模型上，在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（使用500万对数据）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色提示有效提升了合成数据的语义多样性和质量，在保持数据量不变的情况下显著改善了CLIP模型的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

Result: 该框架在多种恶劣天气场景下实现了最先进的性能表现，能够持续适应真实世界条件。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次强化学习框架有效解决了恶劣天气条件下的视觉感知问题，通过数据驱动和动态协调机制实现了对复杂天气退化的鲁棒处理。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

Conclusion: 为冬季场景下的可靠车道检测奠定了坚实基础，并为全天候自动驾驶研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DINOv3等视觉基础模型在密集下游任务中表现出色，但计算高分辨率特征图需要大量计算资源，存在平方复杂度问题。

Method: 提出BRIXEL知识蒸馏方法，让学生模型学习生成更高分辨率的特征图，而不需要直接处理高分辨率输入图像。

Result: BRIXEL在固定分辨率下大幅超越基线DINOv3模型，能以较低计算成本生成与教师模型相似的特征图。

Conclusion: BRIXEL通过知识蒸馏有效解决了高分辨率特征图计算成本高的问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Motivation: 现有的细胞核检测和分类方法严重依赖劳动密集型的细胞核级标注，且难以充分利用大规模未标记数据来学习判别性细胞核表示。

Method: 提出MUSE方法，核心是NuLo机制（基于细胞核的局部自蒸馏），这是一种坐标引导机制，能够基于预测的细胞核位置进行灵活的局部自蒸馏。通过消除增强视图间严格空间对齐的需求，NuLo实现了关键的跨尺度对齐。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试上进行广泛实验，结果表明MUSE有效解决了组织病理学细胞核检测和分类的核心挑战。所得模型不仅超越了最先进的监督基线，还优于通用的病理学基础模型。

Conclusion: MUSE方法通过创新的自监督学习机制，成功解决了组织病理学细胞核检测和分类中的关键问题，为充分利用未标记病理图像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Motivation: 扩展原始Walk the Lines算法，使其不仅适用于彩色船舶分割，还能处理红外图像中的船舶分割，并扩展到RGB图像中的多种物体分割，满足需要精细分割或高质量样本的专业应用需求。

Method: 通过轮廓跟踪算法替代标准非极大值抑制，将物体轮廓细化至1像素宽的闭合形状，可在前景-背景场景中形成可分割区域。针对红外分割，调整了物体轮廓检测器的输入以适应红外船舶。

Conclusion: WtL2成为需要详细分割或高质量样本的专业应用中具有吸引力的方法，可能加速图像分割若干细分领域的进展。

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet依赖手工条件图和重新训练，限制了灵活性和泛化能力；基于反转的方法虽然对齐效果更好但推理成本高。

Method: FreeControl从单个最优关键时间步执行单步注意力提取，并在整个去噪过程中重复使用；引入潜在条件解耦(LCD)分离关键时间步和噪声潜在表示；支持通过多源参考图像进行组合控制。

Conclusion: FreeControl为测试时控制引入了新范式，无需反转或重新训练即可实现高效的结构指导，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Conclusion: 4D3R框架成功解决了动态场景新视角合成的关键挑战，在保持高质量重建的同时显著降低了计算成本，为动态神经渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于3D U-Net的自动分割方法，用于结直肠肝转移瘤(CRLM)的术中超声图像分割，通过裁剪体积训练策略显著提升了分割精度，实现了接近专家水平的实时手术导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中准确描绘结直肠肝转移瘤对于实现阴性切除边缘至关重要，但由于术中超声图像对比度低、噪声大且依赖操作者，传统方法面临挑战。自动分割可提高超声导航工作流程的精确性和效率。

Method: 使用85名CRLM患者的85个追踪3D术中超声体积数据，通过nnU-Net框架实现3D U-Net。比较了两种变体：完整体积训练和肿瘤周围裁剪区域训练，评估指标包括Dice相似系数、Hausdorff距离和相对体积差异。

Result: 裁剪体积模型在所有指标上显著优于完整体积模型(AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718)，中位DSC=0.74，召回率=0.79，Hausdorff距离=17.1mm，性能与半自动分割相当但速度快约4倍(~1分钟)。前瞻性术中测试证实了稳健一致的性能。

Conclusion: 基于裁剪3D U-Net的CRLM术中超声自动3D分割方法提供了可靠、接近实时的结果，无需配准即可实现高效的超声导航，接近专家级精度，同时显著减少手动工作量和手术时间。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuisineSense是一个通过智能手表和智能眼镜融合手部动作与头部动态来分类中国菜品的系统，采用两阶段检测流程，在27.5小时数据上验证了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自我报告方法存在回忆偏差，基于摄像头的方法涉及隐私问题，现有可穿戴方法主要针对有限食物类型，无法应对中国菜品的多样性。

Method: 集成智能手表的手部动作和智能眼镜的头部动态，设计两阶段检测流程：第一阶段识别进食状态，第二阶段基于进食动作进行细粒度食物类型识别。

Result: 在包含11个食物类别和10名参与者的27.5小时IMU记录数据集上，CuisineSense在进食状态检测和食物分类方面均实现了高准确率。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了一个实用解决方案，系统代码已公开。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了现有基于Chamfer距离的点云生成评估指标存在缺陷，提出了改进的DCD指标和新的SNC指标，并开发了Diffusion Point Transformer模型，在ShapeNet数据集上实现了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D点云技术的重要性日益增长，现有生成模型评估指标存在对缺陷不敏感、无法捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性的问题，需要更可靠的评估方法和更好的生成模型。

Method: 1) 改进评估指标：引入样本对齐和使用Density-Aware Chamfer Distance；2) 提出新指标Surface Normal Concordance来评估表面相似性；3) 基于transformer架构开发Diffusion Point Transformer生成模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上的实验表明，提出的评估指标组合能更全面地评估生成质量，Diffusion Point Transformer模型在生成点云质量方面超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估指标和开发新的transformer-based生成模型，本文为点云生成领域提供了更可靠的评估框架和更高质量的生成解决方案。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AIGC时代，隐写术的容量需求日益重要，但现有方法难以嵌入语义丰富的句子级信息。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法有效解锁了LLMs的新语义隐写能力。

Conclusion: 提出的S²LM方法成功实现了语义丰富的句子级信息隐写，为语义隐写开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了Artic4D数据集和CanonSeg4D框架，用于4D铰接物体全景分割，通过将物体部分映射到规范空间来提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铰接物体感知方法大多忽略时间动态性，缺乏4D时间数据探索和基准数据集，限制了该领域发展。

Method: 构建Artic4D数据集，提出CanonSeg4D框架，通过估计每帧偏移将物体部分映射到学习的规范空间，实现跨帧一致性对齐。

Result: 在Artic4D数据集上的实验表明，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景下的全景分割精度优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 时间建模和规范对齐在动态物体理解中具有有效性，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

Conclusion: 本文通过提出密集运动描述任务、构建大规模数据集CompMo和开发DEMO模型，为3D运动理解研究提供了重要基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1是一个基于偏好-响应解耦强化学习的视觉质量评估框架，统一了绝对分数回归和相对排序一致性，在图像和视频质量评估任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨域泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出PreResQ-R1框架，采用双分支奖励公式分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行优化，并设计了全局-时间局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 仅使用6K图像和28K视频进行强化学习微调，在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中取得最优结果，SRCC和PLCC指标分别提升5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1不仅实现了定量性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒绝环境（如行星探测）中，视觉位置识别因混叠和弱纹理而失败，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更稳健的环路闭合检测方案。

Method: 采用基于transformer的基础模型，结合两阶段视觉检索策略和显式6-DoF姿态估计，使用DINOv2特征与SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，SONATA LiDAR描述符进行几何验证。

Result: 在S3LI数据集和S3LI Vulcano数据集上的实验表明，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，并在低纹理区域增强了姿态估计的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPRF在准确性、效率和可靠性之间实现了有利的权衡，展示了基础模型统一位置识别和姿态估计的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is

*Dogucan Yaman,Seymanur Akti,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于HierSpeech++潜在语音表示的文本到说话人脸合成框架，通过Text-to-Vec模块生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，联合调节语音和面部生成。采用两阶段训练处理特征分布偏移，实现紧密的视听对齐和自然表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到说话人脸合成中音频-视觉对齐和身份保持的挑战，避免推理时对真实音频的依赖。

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，采用两阶段训练策略：先在Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，然后在TTS输出上微调。

Result: 实验表明，基于TTS预测潜在特征的调节优于级联管道，提高了唇部同步和视觉真实感。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成自然、表达丰富的语音和同步的面部运动，同时保持说话者身份，无需推理时的真实音频。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: 本文提出gitmerge3D方法，通过全局信息图令牌合并技术将3D点云变换器中的令牌数量减少90-95%，同时保持竞争性性能，挑战了更多令牌带来更好性能的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云变换器依赖密集令牌表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂。研究发现令牌存在显著冗余，造成效率低下。

Method: 提出gitmerge3D方法，一种全局信息图令牌合并技术，能够显著减少令牌数量。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中验证，令牌数量减少90-95%的同时保持竞争性性能，计算效率得到一致提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估大规模3D变换器模型中冗余性的工作，为开发更高效的3D基础架构提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

*Olivier Dietrich,Merlin Alfredsson,Emilia Arens,Nando Metzger,Torben Peters,Linus Scheibenreif,Jan Dirk Wegner,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用中分辨率Copernicus卫星图像进行建筑物损坏评估的可行性，并发布了xBD-S12数据集，包含10,315对Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2的灾前灾后图像对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损坏评估来指导人道主义响应，但超高分辨率图像可用性有限，因此研究中分辨率地球观测图像是否能补充支持建筑物损坏评估。

Method: 构建了xBD-S12数据集，与现有xBD基准进行时空对齐，通过一系列实验评估中分辨率图像在建筑物损坏检测和制图方面的表现。

Result: 研究表明在10米地面采样距离下，许多灾害场景中建筑物损坏可以被较好地检测和制图，但复杂模型架构在泛化到未见灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型带来的实际效益有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus图像是快速、广域损坏评估的可行数据源，可以与超高分辨率图像一起发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于人脸信息的照片年代估计方法，通过分析照片中人物的面部特征来推断拍摄年份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统照片年代估计主要依赖场景信息，而人脸信息作为重要的时间线索尚未被充分挖掘。

Method: 构建了包含160万标注人脸的CSFD-1.6M数据集，提出概率框架结合人脸识别、年龄估计模型和职业时间先验来推断拍摄年份。

Result: 多个人脸信息聚合能显著提升性能，在包含多个可识别个体的图像上表现优于基于场景的基线方法。

Conclusion: 人脸信息是照片年代估计的有效线索，多脸信息聚合能提高估计准确性。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经形态传感器的实时流型分类框架，利用事件数据优于传统图像方法，LSTM模型达到97.6%准确率和0.28ms处理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流沸腾是高效传热机制，但流型突变会破坏热性能，需要准确低延迟的实时监测。传统光学成像方法计算量大、时间分辨率不足，无法捕捉瞬态流动行为。

Method: 开发基于神经形态传感器信号的实时框架，传感器检测像素亮度变化对应边缘运动，无需全帧重建。构建五种分类模型，比较传统图像数据和事件数据。

Result: 利用事件数据的模型优于基于帧的方法，对动态流动特征更敏感。事件LSTM模型在准确性和速度间最佳平衡，达到97.6%分类准确率和0.28ms处理时间。

Conclusion: 异步处理流水线支持连续低延迟预测，通过多数投票机制提供稳定输出，为实验控制和智能热管理提供可靠实时反馈。

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeSearch-R将时序搜索重新定义为交错的文本-视频思考过程，通过强化学习将视频片段搜索整合到推理过程中，并提出GRPO-CSV方法来解决强化学习训练中的问题，在多个基准测试中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时序搜索方法通常依赖手工设计的搜索过程，缺乏端到端优化来学习最优搜索策略。

Method: 提出TimeSearch-R框架，将时序搜索重新定义为交错的文本-视频思考过程，使用强化学习整合视频搜索到推理中，并引入GRPO-CSV方法通过完整性自验证来改进视频推理的完整性。

Result: 在Haystack-LVBench、Haystack-Ego4D等时序搜索基准以及VideoMME、MLVU等长视频理解基准上取得显著改进，在LongVideoBench上相比基础模型Qwen2.5-VL提升4.1%，相比先进视频推理模型Video-R1提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过将时序搜索重新定义为交错的文本-视频思考过程，并引入GRPO-CSV方法，显著提升了时序搜索和长视频理解的性能。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Visual Spatial Tuning (VST) 是一个增强视觉语言模型空间能力的框架，包含VST-P（410万样本）和VST-R（13.5万样本）数据集，通过监督微调和强化学习提升空间感知与推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强视觉语言模型的空间感知与推理能力，使其具备类人的空间智能，同时避免引入额外编码器带来的开销和通用能力损害。

Method: 构建大规模空间感知数据集VST-P和空间推理数据集VST-R，采用渐进式训练流程：先监督微调建立基础空间知识，再通过强化学习提升空间推理能力。

Result: 在多个空间基准测试中取得最优结果，包括MMSI-Bench上的34.8%和VSIBench上的61.2%，且不损害模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: VST框架显著提升了视觉语言动作模型的空间能力，为开发更具物理基础的AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究大型语言模型在程序序列推理任务中的表现，通过使用食谱数据集评估模型从乱序步骤重建正确序列的能力，发现模型性能随序列长度增加和步骤位移加剧而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在程序序列推理中的能力，特别是在步骤顺序直接影响结果的领域（如食谱），评估模型处理乱序步骤重建正确序列的局限性。

Method: 使用食谱数据集，在零样本和少样本设置下评估多个LLM，采用Kendall's Tau、NLCS和NED等排序和序列对齐指标构建综合评估框架。

Result: 模型性能随序列长度增加而下降，输入步骤位移越大（即乱序程度越严重），模型性能下降越明显，表明当前LLM在程序推理方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在程序序列推理任务中表现有限，特别是在处理较长和更混乱的输入时，这凸显了在程序推理能力方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly
impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In
this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from
shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain
where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several
LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive
evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence
alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence
(NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects
of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with
increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer
procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input,
corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning,
especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个基于项目反应理论的自适应测试框架，通过Fisher信息指导的项目选择来估计模型能力，能够在保持测量精度的同时减少90%的测试项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型评估需要数千个基准项目，成本高昂且效率低下，现有方法对所有项目一视同仁，忽略了项目质量和信息量的差异。

Method: 使用项目反应理论(IRT)和Fisher信息指导的项目选择方法，动态选择最具信息量的测试项目来估计模型能力。

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上仅用42个项目(原5608个)就达到了与完整基准相当的估计精度(MAE=0.154)，项目暴露率低于10%，测试重叠率16-27%。IRT排名与准确率排名存在显著差异，23-31%的模型排名变化超过10位。

Conclusion: ATLAS框架显著提高了语言模型评估的效率，揭示了静态基准中存在的标注错误问题，为更精确和高效的模型评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language model evaluation requires thousands of benchmark items, making
evaluations expensive and slow. Existing methods compute average accuracy
across fixed item sets, treating all items equally despite varying quality and
informativeness. We present ATLAS an adaptive testing framework using Item
Response Theory (IRT) to estimate model ability through Fisher
information-guided item selection. Our analysis of five major benchmarks
reveals that 3-6% of items exhibit negative discrimination, indicating
annotation errors that corrupt static evaluation. ATLAS achieves 90% item
reduction while maintaining measurement precision: on HellaSwag (5,608 items),
we match full-benchmark estimates using only 42 items with 0.154 MAE. Our
framework maintains item exposure rates below 10% and test overlap at 16-27%,
compared to static benchmarks where every model sees all items (100% exposure).
Among 4,000+ tested models, IRT ranks differ from accuracy ranks: models with
the same accuracy get different IRT scores, and 23-31% of all models shift by
more than 10 rank positions. Code and calibrated item banks are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出将指令层次解析重构为推理任务，通过构建VerIH数据集和轻量级强化学习训练，使LLM能够优先处理系统指令而非用户指令，从而提升模型的可控性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实决策中承担重要角色，需要处理来自多个来源的竞争性指令，建立指令层次结构对于LLM的可靠性和可控性至关重要。

Method: 将指令层次解析重构为推理任务，构建VerIH数据集（包含对齐和冲突的系统-用户指令），采用轻量级强化学习训练模型。

Result: 微调后的模型在指令遵循和指令层次基准测试中表现一致提升，推理能力可泛化到安全关键场景，增强了对越狱和提示注入攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过指令层次推理为构建可靠LLM提供了实用路径，系统提示的更新可带来可控且鲁棒的模型行为变化。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) based systems take on high-stakes roles in
real-world decision-making, they must reconcile competing instructions from
multiple sources (e.g., model developers, users, and tools) within a single
prompt context. Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where
higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the
reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction
hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first
"think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority
(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability
via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of
constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both
aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight
reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning
capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models
achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction
hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to
safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety
issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined
higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against
jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that
reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable
LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in
model behavior.

TL;DR: 研究发现基础LLMs在语义校准方面表现良好，能够有意义地评估开放域问答任务中的置信度，尽管没有经过明确训练。理论机制解释了语义校准作为下一个令牌预测副产品的出现原因，并预测了三个可验证的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常缺乏对其输出的有意义的置信度估计。虽然基础LLMs已知具有下一个令牌校准特性，但不清楚它们是否能在令牌级别之外评估响应的实际含义置信度。

Method: 使用基于采样的语义校准概念，建立理论机制解释语义校准如何作为下一个令牌预测的副产品出现，提出B-校准的一般定义，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 实验验证了三个预测：(1)基础LLMs在问答任务中具有语义校准；(2)RL指令微调系统性破坏这种校准；(3)思维链推理破坏校准。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供了关于LLMs中语义校准何时以及为何出现的原理性解释，表明基础LLMs在语义校准方面表现良好，而某些训练方法会破坏这种校准特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack meaningful confidence estimates for
their outputs. While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it
remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of
their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain
sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably
well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain
question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our
main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic
calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a
recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory
relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of
calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or
otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base
LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own
distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We
state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through
experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across
question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this
calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our
knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why
semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.

Motivation: 早期检测心理健康障碍对于及时提供支持、风险评估和转诊至关重要。社交媒体文本为心理健康监测提供了丰富的数据源，需要开发准确可靠的多分类模型。

Method: 基于多个精选数据集，对RoBERTa模型进行微调，构建multiMentalRoBERTa模型。使用层集成梯度和KeyBERT等方法进行可解释性分析，比较传统机器学习方法、领域特定transformer和基于提示的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 微调的transformer模型在敏感情境下提供了可靠且可解释的检测方案，强调了公平性、偏见缓解和人机协同安全协议的重要性。multiMentalRoBERTa是一个轻量级、稳健且可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: The early detection of mental health disorders from social media text is
critical for enabling timely support, risk assessment, and referral to
appropriate resources. This work introduces multiMentalRoBERTa, a fine-tuned
RoBERTa model designed for multiclass classification of common mental health
conditions, including stress, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), suicidal ideation, and neutral discourse. Drawing on multiple
curated datasets, data exploration is conducted to analyze class overlaps,
revealing strong correlations between depression and suicidal ideation as well
as anxiety and PTSD, while stress emerges as a broad, overlapping category.
Comparative experiments with traditional machine learning methods,
domain-specific transformers, and prompting-based large language models
demonstrate that multiMentalRoBERTa achieves superior performance, with macro
F1-scores of 0.839 in the six-class setup and 0.870 in the five-class setup
(excluding stress), outperforming both fine-tuned MentalBERT and baseline
classifiers. Beyond predictive accuracy, explainability methods, including
Layer Integrated Gradients and KeyBERT, are applied to identify lexical cues
that drive classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing depression
from suicidal ideation. The findings emphasize the effectiveness of fine-tuned
transformers for reliable and interpretable detection in sensitive contexts,
while also underscoring the importance of fairness, bias mitigation, and
human-in-the-loop safety protocols. Overall, multiMentalRoBERTa is presented as
a lightweight, robust, and deployable solution for enhancing support in mental
health platforms.

Conclusion: 为应对这些不足，作者为研究人员和实践者提供了8项关键建议和详细可行的指导，以改进LLM基准测试的开发，确保评估结果具有更好的构念效度。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is crucial for both assessing their
capabilities and identifying safety or robustness issues prior to deployment.
Reliably measuring abstract and complex phenomena such as 'safety' and
'robustness' requires strong construct validity, that is, having measures that
represent what matters to the phenomenon. With a team of 29 expert reviewers,
we conduct a systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks from leading conferences
in natural language processing and machine learning. Across the reviewed
articles, we find patterns related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and
scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the resulting claims. To
address these shortcomings, we provide eight key recommendations and detailed
actionable guidance to researchers and practitioners in developing LLM

iterative manner and can be deployed on low-cost hardware. Leveraging the
SPIDER benchmark for training and evaluation, GEMMA-SQL combines multiple
prompting strategies, including few-shot learning, to enhance SQL query
generation accuracy. The instruction-tuned variant, GEMMA-SQL Instruct,
achieves 66.8% Test-Suite accuracy and 63.3% Exact Set Match accuracy,
outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines such as IRNet, RYANSQL, and
CodeXDavinci. The proposed approach demonstrates that effective prompt design
and targeted instruction tuning can significantly boost performance while

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了先前关于LLM影响函数计算中嵌入层最优的观点，提出中间注意力层更适合影响估计，并开发了新的层间聚合方法和评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型训练样本影响估计方法由于计算复杂度限制，通常只使用部分层。先前研究认为嵌入层最适合影响计算，但本文发现这种基于抵消效应的假设不可靠。

Method: 提出理论和实证证据证明抵消效应的不可靠性，识别中间注意力层作为更好的影响估计器，开发了排名和投票等替代标准平均的层间聚合方法，并提出新的评估指标NDR。

Result: 通过在不同类型和规模的LLM上进行广泛实验，证明第一层并不一定比最后一层更适合影响估计，与领域内先验知识形成对比。

Conclusion: 中间注意力层比嵌入层更适合LLM影响估计，新的层间聚合方法和NDR评估指标能显著提升性能，推翻了先前关于嵌入层最优的结论。

Abstract: Identifying how training samples influence/impact Large Language Model (LLM)
decision-making is essential for effectively interpreting model decisions and
auditing large-scale datasets. Current training sample influence estimation
methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing
information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order
gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of
billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to
some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal
work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for
computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers
are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on
influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work,
we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the
cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better
estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of
aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to
standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to
significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for
evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model
retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR)
that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect.
Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we
concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than
the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior
knowledge in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息熵方差的图像字幕语言多样性度量方法，通过比较人类和模型生成字幕的token级负对数概率分布，发现使用不同评分器会完全颠倒多样性评估结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化图像字幕生成中的语言多样性，比较不同视觉语言大模型与人类在字幕多样性方面的差异，解决现有评估方法可能存在的偏差问题。

Method: 引入信息熵方差作为多样性度量指标，在MSCOCO测试集上比较5种最先进的视觉语言LLM，使用贪心和核采样解码，并与人类字幕对比，采用n-gram语言模型和通用语言模型进行评分。

Result: 使用字幕训练的n-gram模型时，人类的信息熵方差大约是模型的两倍；但使用通用语言模型重新评分相同字幕时，模式完全反转。

Conclusion: 依赖单一评分器可能导致结论完全颠倒，稳健的多样性评估必须在多个评分器下报告信息熵值。

Abstract: We quantify linguistic diversity in image captioning with surprisal variance
- the spread of token-level negative log-probabilities within a caption set. On
the MSCOCO test set, we compare five state-of-the-art vision-and-language LLMs,
decoded with greedy and nucleus sampling, to human captions. Measured with a
caption-trained n-gram LM, humans display roughly twice the surprisal variance
of models, but rescoring the same captions with a general-language model
reverses the pattern. Our analysis introduces the surprisal-based diversity
metric for image captioning. We show that relying on a single scorer can
completely invert conclusions, thus, robust diversity evaluation must report
surprisal under several scorers.

TL;DR: ERPO框架通过探索残差提示来增强强化学习中的训练信号，提高语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型训练时间增长和规模扩大，更多训练提示变为残差提示（零方差奖励），导致训练信号减少和多样性下降，影响训练效果。

Method: 提出ERPO框架，维护每个提示的历史跟踪器，自适应增加残差提示的采样温度，鼓励生成更多样化的推理轨迹，重新激活训练信号。

Result: 在Qwen2.5系列上的实证结果表明，ERPO在多个数学推理基准测试中持续超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: ERPO通过有效利用残差提示，显著提升了强化学习训练语言模型的效果，特别是在数学推理任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an
effective approach for improving the reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs). The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has
demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models
train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts,
those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently,
fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering
effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore
Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages
exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO
maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the
sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct
responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces,
introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results
on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong
baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs可以通过单一低秩适配器可靠地诱导行为自我意识，这种能力表现为激活空间中的线性特征，且具有任务特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs表现出的行为自我意识能力可能带来安全隐患，比如在评估中隐藏真实能力，因此需要研究其产生条件和机制。

Method: 通过在指令调优的LLMs上使用低秩适配器进行受控微调实验，特别是使用单一rank-1 LoRA适配器。

Result: 1) 使用单一rank-1 LoRA适配器可可靠诱导自我意识；2) 学习到的自我意识行为可由激活空间中的单一导向向量捕获；3) 自我意识具有非普遍性和领域局部化特征。

Conclusion: 行为自我意识表现为领域特定的线性特征，可以轻松诱导和调节，这对理解和控制LLMs的安全特性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that LLMs can exhibit behavioral self-awareness:
the ability to accurately describe or predict their own learned behaviors
without explicit supervision. This capability raises safety concerns as it may,
for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during
evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such
self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it
manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs
with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably
induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware
behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation
space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that
self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent
representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral
self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily
induced and modulated.

TL;DR: 提出了SDS KoPub VDR，这是首个大规模公开的韩语公共文档检索基准，包含361个真实文档（40,781页）和600个经过人工验证的查询-页面-答案三元组，用于评估文本检索和多模态检索任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉文档检索基准主要关注英语，忽视了非英语语言和官方出版物的结构复杂性，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 构建了包含361个真实韩语公共文档的语料库，通过多模态模型生成查询并经过严格人工验证，建立了600个查询-页面-答案三元组，涵盖六个主要公共领域和三种推理模式。

Result: 评估揭示了在需要跨模态推理的多模态场景中，即使是先进模型也存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: SDS KoPub VDR不仅能够在文本和多模态检索任务中进行严格细粒度评估，还为推进复杂真实世界文档智能中的多模态AI提供了清晰路线图。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for visual document retrieval (VDR) largely overlook
non-English languages and the structural complexity of official publications.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first
large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding
Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world
documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and
105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables,
charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable
evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were
initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently
underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure
factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public
domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required:
text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We
evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct
retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability
to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2)
multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features
(e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This
dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in
multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art
models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and
fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also
provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world
document intelligence.

TL;DR: BudgetMem是一种内存增强架构，通过选择性记忆策略和特征显著性评分来学习存储重要信息，在严格预算约束下显著减少内存使用，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理长上下文时面临计算和内存限制，现有方法虽然扩展了上下文窗口但成本高昂，需要一种在资源受限部署中实用的解决方案。

Method: 结合选择性记忆策略与特征显著性评分（实体密度、TF-IDF、话语标记、位置偏差），使用学习门控机制和BM25稀疏检索进行高效信息访问。

Result: 在700个问答对测试中，BudgetMem在长文档上仅损失1.0% F1分数，同时节省72.4%内存，且文档越长效益越明显。

Conclusion: BudgetMem为在有限硬件上部署长上下文系统提供了实用途径，使先进语言理解能力更易于普及。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
constraints when processing long contexts, despite growing demand for
applications requiring reasoning over extensive documents, multi-session
dialogues, and book length texts. While recent advances have extended context
windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource
constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented
architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.
Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience
scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide
which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike
existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,
BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval
for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700
question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)
documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves
remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while
saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through
budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline
comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits
increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for
deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access
to advanced language understanding capabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的验证方法来检测Wikidata中的分类错误、过度泛化的子类链接和冗余连接，并开发了一个系统让用户检查任意实体的分类关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata作为最大的开放知识图谱，其相对宽松的编辑政策导致了分类不一致性问题，需要有效的方法来识别和纠正这些错误。

Method: 提出并应用新的验证方法确认分类错误，引入新的评估标准判断问题是否需要修正，开发系统让用户检查分类关系。

Result: 确认了Wikidata特定领域中存在分类错误、过度泛化的子类链接和冗余连接问题。

Conclusion: 通过利用Wikidata众包性质的优势，开发了有效的工具来识别和纠正分类不一致性问题。

Abstract: Wikidata is currently the largest open knowledge graph on the web,
encompassing over 120 million entities. It integrates data from various
domain-specific databases and imports a substantial amount of content from
Wikipedia, while also allowing users to freely edit its content. This openness
has positioned Wikidata as a central resource in knowledge graph research and
has enabled convenient knowledge access for users worldwide. However, its
relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic
inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel
validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors,
over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains
of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining
whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users
to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata
entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential.

Motivation: 长上下文推理场景对大型语言模型日益重要，但带来显著计算延迟。现有并行分词方法因边界伪影导致结果不一致，需要解决分词瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出LoPT框架，采用基于字符位置的匹配和动态块长度调整技术，准确对齐和合并分词片段，确保与顺序分词结果完全一致。

Result: 在多样化长文本数据集上的广泛实验表明，LoPT实现了显著加速，同时保证无损分词，并提供了理论一致性证明和鲁棒性分析。

Conclusion: LoPT成功解决了并行分词中的边界一致性问题，为长文本处理提供了高效且可靠的分词解决方案。

Abstract: Long context inference scenarios have become increasingly important for large
language models, yet they introduce significant computational latency. While
prior research has optimized long-sequence inference through operators, model
architectures, and system frameworks, tokenization remains an overlooked
bottleneck. Existing parallel tokenization methods accelerate processing
through text segmentation and multi-process tokenization, but they suffer from
inconsistent results due to boundary artifacts that occur after merging. To
address this, we propose LoPT, a novel Lossless Parallel Tokenization framework
that ensures output identical to standard sequential tokenization. Our approach
employs character-position-based matching and dynamic chunk length adjustment
to align and merge tokenized segments accurately. Extensive experiments across
diverse long-text datasets demonstrate that LoPT achieves significant speedup
while guaranteeing lossless tokenization. We also provide theoretical proof of
consistency and comprehensive analytical studies to validate the robustness of
our method.

Method: 引入了Moral RolePlay基准测试，包含四级道德对齐量表和平衡测试集，让最先进的LLMs扮演从道德典范到纯粹反派的各种角色。

Result: 大规模评估显示，随着角色道德水平的下降，角色扮演保真度呈现一致的单调下降趋势。模型在与安全原则直接对立的特质（如欺骗性和操纵性）上表现最差。

Conclusion: 研究发现模型安全性与创意保真度之间存在关键张力，为开发更细致、上下文感知的对齐方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.

Abstract: Knowledge about emotional events is an important kind of knowledge which has
been applied to improve the effectiveness of different applications. However,
emotional events cannot be easily acquired, especially common or generalized
emotional events that are context-independent. The goal of this paper is to
obtain common emotional events in Chinese language such as "win a prize" and
"be criticized". Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of
Chinese emotional event indicators. Then, we generate emotional events by
prompting a Chinese large language model (LLM) using these indicators. To
ensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard
invalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being
positive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we
harvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment
polarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of
emotional events in Chinese language. Intrinsic evaluation results show that
the proposed method in this paper can be effectively used to acquire common
Chinese emotional events. An extrinsic use case also demonstrates the strong
potential of common emotional events in the field of emotion cause extraction
(ECE). Related resources including emotional event indicators and emotional
events will be released after the publication of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM应用通常发生在具有独特企业政策、监管要求和使用案例的组织生态系统中，这凸显了对具有多元对齐目标的LLM进行严格评估的需求。

Method: 开发了PBSUITE评估套件，包含基于30个行业的300个现实LLM行为策略数据集，以及用于在对抗条件下压力测试模型合规性的动态评估框架。

Result: 领先的开源和闭源LLMs在单轮设置中保持稳健的行为策略遵守（失败率低于4%），但在多轮对抗交互中合规性显著减弱（失败率高达84%）。

Conclusion: 现有的模型对齐和安全调节方法在现实世界LLM交互中连贯执行多元行为策略方面存在不足，需要开发更稳健和上下文感知的多元对齐技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to a universal set of
safety and usage principles intended for broad public acceptability. Yet,
real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational
ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements,
use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights
the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic
alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse
user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE
(PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs'
capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn,
interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300
realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic
evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral
specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that
leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral
policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their
compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to
84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and
safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic
behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both
the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust
and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了UA-Code-Bench，一个用于评估语言模型在乌克兰语代码生成和竞争性编程问题解决能力的开源基准，包含500个不同难度的问题，评估了13个领先模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注从英语翻译的广泛任务或仅评估简单语言理解，难以评估低资源语言中语言模型的真实能力。

Method: 使用来自Eolymp平台的500个问题，分布在五个难度级别，通过专用环境评估13个领先模型生成的Python解决方案的正确性。

Result: 即使表现最佳的模型（如OpenAI o3和GPT-5）也只能解决一半的问题，突显了在低资源自然语言中代码生成的挑战。

Conclusion: 竞争性编程基准在评估大型语言模型方面具有价值，特别是在代表性不足的语言中，为多语言代码生成和推理增强模型的未来研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource
languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on
widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language
understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark
established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and
competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark
comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five
complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading
proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a
one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against
hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even
top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the
problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural
language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of
performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of
solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time
and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work
demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating
large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves
the way for future research on multilingual code generation and
reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code
generation, and evaluation scripts are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上存在共性，提出了Order-Level Attention (OLA)概念，并基于此开发了无需训练的跨模型适配器TOA，能有效提升未见语言模型的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 探索不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上的共性，以加深对语言模型的理解并促进跨模型知识迁移。

Method: 引入Order-Level Attention (OLA)作为统一的句法特征表示，训练一个以OLA为输入的适配器，利用OLA在不同模型间的相似性实现跨模型泛化。

Result: 实验证明OLA在不同语言模型间具有显著相似性，且TOA方法能有效提升未见语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 不同语言模型在上下文聚合模式上存在共性，基于OLA的TOA方法能实现有效的跨模型知识迁移。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore an important yet previously neglected question: Do
context aggregation patterns across Language Models (LMs) share commonalities?
While some works have investigated context aggregation or attention weights in
LMs, they typically focus on individual models or attention heads, lacking a
systematic analysis across multiple LMs to explore their commonalities. In
contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our
understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In
this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the
order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the
same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we
discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on
these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a
training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA
as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes
OLA as input. Due to the similarities in OLA across LMs, the adapter
generalizes to unseen LMs without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TOA's cross-LM generalization effectively enhances
the performance of unseen LMs. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在罗曼语系和日耳曼语系语言上实现了有效的跨语言泛化，同时在不同语言结构中保持了语义连贯性，证明了仅使用英语数据训练也能实现稳健的跨语言迁移。

Abstract: We address claim normalization for multilingual misinformation detection -
transforming noisy social media posts into clear, verifiable statements across
20 languages. The key contribution demonstrates how systematic decomposition of
posts using Who, What, Where, When, Why and How questions enables robust
cross-lingual transfer despite training exclusively on English data. Our
methodology incorporates finetuning Qwen3-14B using LoRA with the provided
dataset after intra-post deduplication, token-level recall filtering for
semantic alignment and retrieval-augmented few-shot learning with contextual
examples during inference. Our system achieves METEOR scores ranging from 41.16
(English) to 15.21 (Marathi), securing third rank on the English leaderboard
and fourth rank for Dutch and Punjabi. The approach shows 41.3% relative
improvement in METEOR over baseline configurations and substantial gains over
existing methods. Results demonstrate effective cross-lingual generalization
for Romance and Germanic languages while maintaining semantic coherence across
diverse linguistic structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了两种通用大语言模型在文本简化任务中的表现，发现指令调优的Mistral 24B在可读性和语篇保真度平衡方面优于推理增强的QWen2.5 32B，为LLM在科学文档简化中的应用提供了基准性能跟踪和指标选择启发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公众健康信息需求和数字消费的增加，需要可扩展的解决方案来自动将复杂科学文档简化为通俗语言，但现有文本简化方法在可读性和语篇保真度平衡方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 使用指令调优的Mistral 24B和推理增强的QWen2.5 32B两种通用LLM进行对比分析，通过21个指标评估其可读性、语篇保真度、内容安全性和分布特征，并与人类基准进行比较。

Result: Mistral 24B在简化特定指标SARI上达到42.46，BERTScore为0.91，保持了人类水平的语篇保真度；QWen2.5 32B虽然可读性增强，但BERTScore显著较低为0.89，在可读性与准确性平衡方面存在脱节。

Conclusion: 指令调优的Mistral 24B在文本简化任务中具有架构优势，词汇支持是简化的主要领域适应问题，同时确认了五个可读性指标间的功能冗余，为LLM在文本简化中的应用提供了必要启发。

Abstract: The increasing health-seeking behavior and digital consumption of biomedical
information by the general public necessitate scalable solutions for
automatically adapting complex scientific and technical documents into plain
language. Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large
language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating
the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring
preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the
performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their
linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a
human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral
24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential
architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a
tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a
suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46),
while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also
attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a
disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a
statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a
comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability,
discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for
mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five
readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the
evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the
instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics
for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary
domain-adaptation issue for simplification.

*Grigory Kovalev,Mikhail Tikhomirov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型的蒸馏方法，提出了一种基于ShortGPT的改进方法，通过迭代评估层重要性来压缩模型，在Qwen2.5-3B模型上实现了从36层减少到28层（参数减少至24.7亿）仅损失9.7%性能的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够保持高性能的紧凑模型，解决大型语言模型在资源受限环境中的部署问题。

Method: 基于ShortGPT方法改进，采用迭代评估层重要性：通过移除单个层并测量性能退化来评估重要性，结合基于KL散度和均方误差的联合损失函数进行进一步训练。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B模型上，层数从36减少到28（参数24.7亿）仅损失9.7%质量，减少到24层损失18%质量。发现中间transformer层对推理贡献较小。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代蒸馏和微调方法有效，适合在资源受限环境中部署，证明了中间transformer层的重要性较低，为创建高效模型提供了潜力。

Abstract: This work investigates distillation methods for large language models (LLMs)
with the goal of developing compact models that preserve high performance.
Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective
strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach
has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative
evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by
measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a
set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training
using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be
reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a
9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that
the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the
potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making
the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.

Result: 提出的方法在优化质量和效率方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 改进的进化提示优化方法能够部分推广到一般提示优化，为后续研究提供代码支持。

Abstract: Evolutionary prompt optimization has demonstrated effectiveness in refining
prompts for LLMs. However, existing approaches lack robust operators and
efficient evaluation mechanisms. In this work, we propose several key
improvements to evolutionary prompt optimization that can partially generalize
to prompt optimization in general: 1) decomposing evolution into distinct steps
to enhance the evolution and its control, 2) introducing an LLM-based judge to
verify the evolutions, 3) integrating human feedback to refine the evolutionary
operator, and 4) developing more efficient evaluation strategies that maintain
performance while reducing computational overhead. Our approach improves both
optimization quality and efficiency. We release our code, enabling prompt
optimization on new tasks and facilitating further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用Transformer编码器在制造业等专业领域表现不佳，因为缺乏领域特定术语和语义的暴露。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了制造业领域的大规模语料库，包括领域特定过滤和多阶段去重处理，然后基于RoBERTa进行持续预训练得到ManufactuBERT模型。

Conclusion: 提出的数据处理流程为其他专业领域开发高性能编码器提供了可复现的示例，模型和语料库将在HuggingFace上发布。

Abstract: While large general-purpose Transformer-based encoders excel at general
language understanding, their performance diminishes in specialized domains
like manufacturing due to a lack of exposure to domain-specific terminology and
semantics. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a
RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the
manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to
create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific
filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes
redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new
state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming
strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on
our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence,
leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to
training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a
reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other
specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at

Motivation: 探索思维链提示在知识蒸馏中如何帮助将大语言模型的推理能力有效转移到小语言模型，解决小模型在复杂自然语言推理任务中的性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用Qwen和Llama2系列语言模型，基于CoT-Collection数据集的思维链数据，进行白盒知识蒸馏实验，并在BIG-Bench-Hard基准上评估蒸馏模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，思维链在白盒知识蒸馏中发挥了重要作用，使蒸馏模型在BIG-Bench-Hard的自然语言推理和理解任务中获得了更好的平均性能。

Conclusion: 思维链提示能有效提升白盒知识蒸馏的效果，帮助小语言模型获得更好的推理能力，在复杂自然语言任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a widely used method to improve the
reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). More recently, CoT has
been leveraged in Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer reasoning capability
from a larger LLM to a smaller one. This paper examines the role of CoT in
distilling the reasoning capability from larger LLMs to smaller LLMs using
white-box KD, analysing its effectiveness in improving the performance of the
distilled models for various natural language reasoning and understanding
tasks. We conduct white-box KD experiments using LLMs from the Qwen and Llama2
families, employing CoT data from the CoT-Collection dataset. The distilled
models are then evaluated on natural language reasoning and understanding tasks
from the BIG-Bench-Hard (BBH) benchmark, which presents complex challenges for
smaller LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the role of CoT in improving
white-box KD effectiveness, enabling the distilled models to achieve better
average performance in natural language reasoning and understanding tasks from
BBH.

Motivation: 研究古汉语到日语的翻译标注系统面临低资源问题，需要开发有效的解决方案。

Method: 引入基于大语言模型的标注流程，从数字化开源翻译数据构建新数据集，并利用辅助中文NLP任务来提升序列标注任务的训练效果。

Result: 在低资源设置下，引入辅助中文NLP任务对序列标注训练有促进作用；大语言模型在直接机器翻译中表现优秀，但在字符标注任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法可以作为大语言模型的补充方案，在特定翻译标注任务中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Ancient people translated classical Chinese into Japanese by annotating
around each character. We abstract this process as sequence tagging tasks and
fit them into modern language technologies. The research of this annotation and
translation system is a facing low-resource problem. We release this problem by
introducing a LLM-based annotation pipeline and construct a new dataset from
digitalized open-source translation data. We show that under the low-resource
setting, introducing auxiliary Chinese NLP tasks has a promoting effect on the
training of sequence tagging tasks. We also evaluate the performance of large
language models. They achieve high scores in direct machine translation, but
they are confused when being asked to annotate characters. Our method could
work as a supplement of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPO框架通过将内容生成与个性化对齐解耦，采用两阶段方法：首先生成通用高质量响应，然后通过反射模块重写以对齐用户偏好，显著提升了大型语言模型的个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文注入的个性化方法让模型同时承担内容生成和风格对齐的双重负担，导致输出质量下降和控制精度有限。需要解决这一基本矛盾。

Method: 提出反射个性化优化(RPO)框架，包含两个阶段：基础模型生成通用响应，外部反射模块重写对齐用户偏好。反射模块采用监督微调建立个性化推理策略，再通过强化学习优化输出质量。

Result: 在LaMP基准测试上的综合实验表明，RPO通过解耦内容生成与个性化，显著优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 明确响应塑造优于隐式上下文注入，RPO引入了高效、模型无关的个性化层，可与任何基础模型无缝集成，为用户中心生成场景开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The personalization of black-box large language models (LLMs) is a critical
yet challenging task. Existing approaches predominantly rely on context
injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the
generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on
the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with
user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output
quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we
propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that
redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from
alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a
high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly
rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection
module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning
is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core
personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to
user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to
further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.
Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by
decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of
explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO
introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be
seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new
and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种针对播客内容分析的微调BERT模型，通过将叙事框架与对话中提到的具体实体关联起来，解决了现有语言模型在处理非结构化、对话式播客数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 播客已成为塑造公众舆论的重要媒介，但其非脚本化、多主题和对话式的特点使得自动分析变得困难。现有语言模型难以捕捉人类听众识别叙事框架的微妙线索，无法准确进行大规模播客叙事分析。

Method: 开发并评估了一个微调BERT模型，明确将叙事框架与对话中提到的具体实体关联，将抽象框架锚定在具体细节上。然后使用这些细粒度的框架标签，并将其与高级主题相关联以揭示更广泛的话语趋势。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的框架标注方法，更接近人类对混乱对话数据的判断；揭示了讨论内容（主题）与呈现方式（框架）之间的系统性关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究数字媒体影响力提供了一个更稳健的框架，能够更准确地分析播客中的叙事结构和说服机制。

Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them
a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically
unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex
form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine
their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant
challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models,
typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to
capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative
frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing
podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that
explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the
conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our
approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with
high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions
of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely
aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new
analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being
discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a
more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了从斯洛伐克法院判决中提取犯罪行为描述的可行性，比较了正则表达式和大型语言模型两种方法，发现两者都能显著提高提取准确率，组合方法可达99.5%的识别率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用欧洲大陆法院判决中未被充分利用的犯罪行为描述信息，这些描述包含比刑事司法行政数据更丰富的犯罪细节。

Method: 使用两种方法：基于正则表达式的简单和高级方法，以及使用Gemini Flash 2.0 LLM的提示工程方法。

Result: 基线方法仅识别40.5%的描述，而高级正则表达式达97%，LLMs达98.75%，组合方法达99.5%。人工评估显示高级方法与人类标注匹配度约90%。

Conclusion: 正则表达式和LLMs都能有效提取法院判决中的犯罪行为描述，组合方法效果最佳，为刑事司法研究提供了新的数据来源。

Abstract: Criminal justice administrative data contain only a limited amount of
information about the committed offense. However, there is an unused source of
extensive information in continental European courts' decisions: descriptions
of criminal behaviors in verdicts by which offenders are found guilty. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of extracting these descriptions from publicly
available court decisions from Slovakia. We use two different approaches for
retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline
was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words
occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression
approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of
spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description.
The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the
descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified
descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed
it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and
99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced
methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5%
for the baseline. LLMs fully matched human-labeled descriptions in 91.75% of
instances, and a combination of advanced regular expressions with LLMs reached
92%.

TL;DR: 提出了BengaliBPE，一种专门为孟加拉语设计的BPE分词器，通过Unicode标准化、字素级初始化和形态感知合并规则来改进对形态丰富语言的分词效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的分词器如SentencePiece或HuggingFace BPE主要针对拉丁语或多语言语料库设计，在形态丰富的语言如孟加拉语上表现不佳，需要专门的语言感知分词方法。

Method: 开发BengaliBPE分词器，应用Unicode标准化、字素级初始化和形态感知合并规则，使用大规模孟加拉语新闻分类数据集与三种基线方法进行比较。

Result: BengaliBPE提供了最详细的分割和最佳的形态可解释性，尽管计算成本略高，所有方法在分类准确率上都表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语言感知分词对形态丰富语言的重要性，BengaliBPE为未来孟加拉语NLP系统奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Tokenization is an important first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipelines because it decides how models learn and represent linguistic
information. However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or
HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do
not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address
this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode
normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules
to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a
large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with
three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The
evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream
classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE
provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological
interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These
findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for
morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation
for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual

### [81] [Minority-Aware Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue Systems via Preference-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05407)
*Yahui Fu,Zi Haur Pang,Tatsuya Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一框架来建模个体和群体层面的用户满意度偏好，通过个性化推理链和多数-少数偏好聚类算法，结合偏好自适应强化学习来提升对话系统的用户满意度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话系统对齐方法通常训练一刀切的模型，追求广泛共识，但忽视了少数用户群体的观点和用户特定的适应性需求。由于用户满意度具有主观性，相同的响应策略在不同用户中可能产生不同的满意度评分。

Method: 1. 引入个性化推理链(CoPeR)通过可解释的推理链捕捉个体偏好；2. 提出基于期望最大化的多数-少数偏好感知聚类算法(M2PC)，以无监督方式发现不同用户群体并学习群体级偏好；3. 将这些组件集成到偏好自适应强化学习框架(PAda-PPO)中，联合优化个体和群体偏好的对齐。

Result: 在情感支持对话数据集上的实验表明，该方法在用户满意度估计方面取得了持续改进，特别是对于代表性不足的用户群体。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模个体和群体层面的用户偏好，显著提升对话系统的用户满意度估计性能，特别是在处理少数用户群体方面表现出色。

Abstract: User satisfaction in dialogue systems is inherently subjective. When the same
response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different
satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual
intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train
one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking
minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified
framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user
satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning
(CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning
chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority
Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user
groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we
integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning
framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and
group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset
demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation,
particularly for underrepresented user groups.

### [82] [Steering Language Models with Weight Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05408)
*Constanza Fierro,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出对比权重导向方法，通过权重算术编辑模型参数，利用窄分布训练数据实现更好的行为控制，在减少奉承行为和诱导不对齐方面表现出色，并能检测训练过程中的不对齐行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多样化训练分布上为大型语言模型提供高质量反馈既困难又昂贵，而仅在窄分布上提供反馈可能导致意外的泛化问题。需要找到更好利用窄训练数据的方法。

Method: 提出对比权重导向方法：通过两个小型微调的权重差值来隔离行为方向（一个诱导期望行为，另一个诱导相反行为），然后通过添加或移除该方向来修改模型权重。

Result: 权重导向比激活导向具有更好的泛化能力，在分布外行为控制方面表现更强，同时能减轻微调引入的不良行为漂移（如奉承行为和拒绝不足），保持任务性能增益。还能通过权重相似性检测新兴不对齐行为。

Conclusion: 对比权重导向是一种有效的后训练方法，能够更好地利用窄训练数据实现行为控制，检测训练过程中的不对齐行为，为模型安全监控提供了新途径。

Abstract: Providing high-quality feedback to Large Language Models (LLMs) on a diverse
training distribution can be difficult and expensive, and providing feedback
only on a narrow distribution can result in unintended generalizations. To
better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a
simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight
arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the
weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired
behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this
direction to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate
sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often
generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger
out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.
We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering
can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and
under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance
gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can
be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an
"evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the
evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that
never manifest during training or evaluations.

### [83] [MIMIC-SR-ICD11: A Dataset for Narrative-Based Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05485)
*Yuexin Wu,Shiqi Wang,Vasile Rus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MIMIC-SR-ICD11数据集和LL-Rank重排序框架，用于改进基于临床报告的疾病诊断。LL-Rank通过计算标签在临床报告上下文中的联合似然度，并减去无报告的先验似然度，有效提升了诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病诊断是现代医疗的核心，但电子健康记录（EHR）文档往往会衰减或遗漏临床重要信号。自述报告能保留这些细微但重要的细节，因此需要开发能够有效利用这些信息的方法。

Method: 提出了LL-Rank框架，这是一个基于似然度的重排序方法。它计算每个标签在临床报告上下文中的长度归一化联合似然度，然后减去该标签的无报告先验似然度。该方法使用PMI（点互信息）评分来隔离语义兼容性和标签频率偏差。

Result: 在七个模型骨干上，LL-Rank始终优于强基线方法GenMap（生成加映射）。消融实验表明，LL-Rank的性能提升主要来自其基于PMI的评分机制。

Conclusion: LL-Rank框架通过隔离语义兼容性和标签频率偏差，有效提升了临床诊断任务的性能，为基于临床报告的疾病诊断提供了更准确的方法。

Abstract: Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early
detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle
adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease.
Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic
health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle
but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce
MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge
notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present
LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a
length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report
context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that
label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong
generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that
LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates
semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.

### [85] [Epistemic Reject Option Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04855)
*Vojtech Franc,Jakub Paplham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于认知不确定性的拒绝选项预测器，在数据不足导致认知不确定性高的区域拒绝预测，以最小化期望遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝选项方法只关注偶然不确定性，假设训练数据充足使得认知不确定性可忽略。但在实际应用中，数据有限使得这一假设不成立，需要同时考虑认知不确定性。

Method: 基于贝叶斯学习，重新定义最优预测器为最小化期望遗憾的预测器，当给定输入的遗憾超过指定拒绝成本时拒绝预测。

Result: 提出了第一个原则性框架，能够学习识别训练数据不足以做出可靠决策的输入的预测器。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用中的不确定性量化提供了更全面的解决方案，特别适用于数据有限的场景。

Abstract: In high-stakes applications, predictive models must not only produce accurate
predictions but also quantify and communicate their uncertainty. Reject-option
prediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction
uncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on
aleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes
the epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,
limited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the
epistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic
uncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we
redefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the
performance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with
full knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for
a given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of
identifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable
decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DMA是一个在线学习框架，通过整合多粒度人类反馈来动态调整RAG系统的检索排名，解决了静态检索无法适应意图变化和内容漂移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RAG系统依赖静态检索，无法适应不断变化的用户意图和内容漂移，需要一种能够实时学习和适应的动态方法。

Method: DMA将文档级、列表级和响应级信号整合到连贯的学习流程中：监督训练点对和列表排序器，基于响应级偏好的策略优化，以及将知识蒸馏到轻量级评分器中以实现低延迟服务。

Result: 在线部署显示人类参与度显著提升，离线测试在TriviaQA和HotpotQA等对话QA任务上取得显著收益，同时保持了基础检索的竞争力。

Conclusion: DMA为RAG系统提供了一种原则性的反馈驱动实时适应方法，在不牺牲基线能力的情况下实现了持续改进。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often rely on static retrieval,
limiting adaptation to evolving intent and content drift. We introduce Dynamic
Memory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically
incorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive
settings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a
coherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise
rankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and
knowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.
Throughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is
the entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.
  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)
large-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback
source, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.
Online, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial
improvements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive
foundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA
(TriviaQA, HotpotQA). Taken together, these results position DMA as a
principled approach to feedback-driven, real-time adaptation in RAG without
sacrificing baseline capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为军事地面作战执行阶段的决策提供支持，特别是在机械化营的行动规划方面，需要系统化的方法来生成和评估各种行动方案。

Method: 从初始行动方案集开始，系统生成数千个个体行动替代方案，结合敌方状态、部队组成、兵力比、攻防类型和预期推进率等因素进行评价，生成和评价过程并行运行，在作战过程中动态更新行动方案。

Result: 该方法能够产生具有更优结果的替代行动方案，为决策者提供多样化的选择，并在战斗条件变化时及时修订行动方案。

Conclusion: 该决策支持方法能够在动态军事作战环境中有效生成和评估行动方案，支持机械化营的连续决策过程。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a methodology designed to support decision-making
during the execution phase of military ground combat operations, with a focus
on one's actions. This methodology generates and evaluates recommendations for
various courses of action for a mechanized battalion, commencing with an
initial set assessed by their anticipated outcomes. It systematically produces
thousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at
identifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These
alternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,
considering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and
anticipated advance rates. Field manuals evaluate battle outcomes and
advancement rates. The processes of generation and evaluation work
concurrently, yielding a variety of alternative courses of action. This
approach facilitates the management of new course generation based on
previously evaluated actions. As the combat unfolds and conditions evolve,
revised courses of action are formulated for the decision-maker within a
sequential decision-making framework.

Motivation: 经济约束、数据集可用性有限以及专业人才短缺是汽车行业预测性维护面临的主要挑战，LLM的进展为克服这些障碍提供了机会。

Method: 评估LLM智能体在处理维护日志中六种不同类型噪声（如拼写错误、缺失字段、近似重复条目和错误日期等）的清洗任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLM在处理通用清洗任务方面表现有效，为未来工业应用提供了有前景的基础，但领域特定错误仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: LLM在预测性维护数据清洗方面具有潜力，通过专业化训练和增强智能体能力可以进一步改进性能。

Abstract: Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
agentic capabilities.

Motivation: 当前AI在城市规划分析方面已很成功，但需要进一步发展AI辅助决策能力，让智能体能够推荐地点、分配资源、评估权衡，并透明地推理约束和利益相关者价值。

Method: 提出了Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework，包含感知层、基础层和推理层三个认知层，以及分析、生成、验证、评估、协作和决策六个逻辑组件，采用多智能体协作框架。

Result: 框架展示了AI智能体如何通过系统探索解决方案空间、验证法规合规性和透明地权衡利弊来增强人类规划者，而不是取代人类判断。

Conclusion: 该框架表明AI智能体可以通过计算推理能力增强人类规划者，实现价值导向、规则基础和可解释的规划决策，这是纯统计学习方法无法满足的要求。

Abstract: AI has proven highly successful at urban planning analysis -- learning
patterns from data to predict future conditions. The next frontier is
AI-assisted decision-making: agents that recommend sites, allocate resources,
and evaluate trade-offs while reasoning transparently about constraints and
stakeholder values. Recent breakthroughs in reasoning AI -- CoT prompting,
ReAct, and multi-agent collaboration frameworks -- now make this vision
achievable.
  This position paper presents the Agentic Urban Planning AI Framework for
reasoning-capable planning agents that integrates three cognitive layers
(Perception, Foundation, Reasoning) with six logic components (Analysis,
Generation, Verification, Evaluation, Collaboration, Decision) through a
multi-agents collaboration framework. We demonstrate why planning decisions
require explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying
normative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),
and explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that
statistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with
statistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark
evaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges. This framework
shows how AI agents can augment human planners by systematically exploring
solution spaces, verifying regulatory compliance, and deliberating over
trade-offs transparently -- not replacing human judgment but amplifying it with
computational reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 当前检索系统混淆了查找相关信息和为推理提供足够上下文这两个独立过程，需要区分搜索和检索的不同功能。

Method: 采用双层架构设计，将小的语义准确搜索块直接连接到大的上下文完整检索块，不增加额外处理成本。

Result: SINR框架将检索从被动步骤转变为主动过程，使系统架构更符合人类信息处理方式。

Conclusion: 为下一代使用检索的AI系统提供了实用基础，讨论了概念基础、形式结构、实现问题和定性结果。

Abstract: Retrieval systems are essential to contemporary AI pipelines, although most
confuse two separate processes: finding relevant information and giving enough
context for reasoning. We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR)
framework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained
search representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the
composability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by
directly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger,
contextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing
costs. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one,
making the system architecture more like how people process information. We
discuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure,
implementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical
foundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval.

Motivation: 金融领域LLM应用需要准确的信息检索，但现有基准无法捕捉真实银行场景的复杂信息需求，构建领域特定基准成本高且受法律限制。

Method: 提出系统化方法，结合单文档和多文档查询生成，以及增强的推理辅助可回答性评估方法，构建银行领域IR基准KoBankIR。

Result: 构建了包含815个查询的KoBankIR基准，实验表明现有检索模型在处理复杂多文档查询时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该方法为领域特定基准构建提供了系统化途径，强调了金融领域需要改进检索技术。

Abstract: As financial applications of large language models (LLMs) gain attention,
accurate Information Retrieval (IR) remains crucial for reliable AI services.
However, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific
information needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR
benchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real
customer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology
for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query
generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline
combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and
reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger
alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology,
we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking
documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with
the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our
systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring
the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel series of Russian information retrieval
datasets constructed from the "Did you know..." section of Russian Wikipedia.
Our datasets support a range of retrieval tasks, including fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation, and full-document retrieval, by leveraging
interesting facts and their referenced Wikipedia articles annotated at the
sentence level with graded relevance. We describe the methodology for dataset
creation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval
(IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research
by comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art
neural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models.
Results of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural
models on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture
lexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained
retrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of
document length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining
retrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution
expands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and
highlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve
optimal performance. All datasets are publicly available at HuggingFace. To
facilitate reproducibility and future research, we also release the full
implementation on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV缓存管理策略与模型架构限制的交互作用：当累积KV缓存接近或超过模型训练上下文窗口时，LLM生成质量急剧下降，常见逐出策略可能因破坏位置一致性而恶化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在状态化多轮场景中KV缓存无界增长带来的挑战，特别是关注KV缓存管理策略、模型架构上下文限制与位置编码完整性之间的相互作用。

Method: 使用状态化基准测试框架进行实证分析，比较不同KV缓存逐出策略（包括高保留率策略如AttentionTop）对生成质量的影响。

Result: 当累积KV缓存接近或超过模型训练上下文窗口（如Llama 3的8192个token）时，LLM生成质量急剧下降；即使高保留率的逐出策略也可能因破坏位置一致性而恶化性能；保留连续上下文块的简单策略比复杂或位置破坏性策略产生更连贯的生成结果。

Conclusion: 应开发尊重架构限制、保持位置结构并超越单纯缓存大小的"缓存健康"整体视角的逐出技术。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将主观反馈与定量传感器信息相结合，同时保持了基于偏好的搜索的灵活性，在人在环校准任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

*Vaibhav Singh,Eugene Belilovsky,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在数据稀缺和分布偏移场景下，通过知识蒸馏从已grokking的模型转移知识，可以诱导和加速新分布的grokking现象，并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在训练样本低于临界阈值的数据稀缺情况下，以及面临分布偏移的实际场景中，如何实现模型的延迟泛化(grokking)现象。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏(KD)从在分布p1上已grokking的模型向新分布p2转移知识；研究联合分布训练和持续预训练设置下的知识迁移效果。

Result: KD能够诱导和加速新分布的grokking，即使在数据低于临界阈值时；在联合分布训练中，KD实现泛化而标准训练失败；在持续预训练中，KD加速泛化并缓解灾难性遗忘，仅用10%数据即可获得强性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在低数据和分布演化设置中对于实现泛化具有核心作用，为知识转移下的grokking机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

TL;DR: FuseFlow是一个将PyTorch稀疏模型转换为融合稀疏数据流图的编译器，支持跨表达式融合、并行化等优化，针对可重构数据流架构，通过设计空间探索发现完全融合并非总是最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型规模扩大，稀疏计算和专用数据流硬件成为解决效率问题的有效方案，需要编译器支持稀疏操作的跨表达式融合。

Method: 开发FuseFlow编译器，将PyTorch稀疏模型转换为融合稀疏数据流图，支持跨表达式融合、并行化、数据流排序和稀疏分块等优化，并针对周期精确的数据流模拟器进行微架构分析。

Result: 在四个真实世界机器学习应用中进行设计空间探索，发现完全融合对稀疏模型并非总是最优，融合粒度取决于模型本身。FuseFlow提供启发式方法识别和修剪次优配置，在GPT-3 BigBird块稀疏注意力上实现约2.7倍加速。

Conclusion: FuseFlow是首个支持稀疏操作通用跨表达式融合的编译器，证明了融合粒度对稀疏模型性能的重要性，并为稀疏计算提供了有效的编译优化框架。

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数据收集和表示学习在预测任务中很成功，但在因果任务（如预测干预效果）中表现不佳，需要将表示学习与因果推断相结合。

Method: 提出一个统计和计算框架，利用多模态数据（观察性和扰动性数据）进行因果结构学习和表示学习，包括因果发现、多模态视图学习和最优扰动设计。

Result: 框架旨在更有效地利用观察性和扰动性数据来发现因果变量，并通过多模态视图学习因果变量。

Conclusion: 通过结合表示学习和因果推断，可以更好地理解复杂现象并做出更好的决策，特别是在生物医学领域。

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

TL;DR: 提出CNODE框架，使用神经ODE建模帕金森病脑形态变化的连续时间过程，通过患者特异性初始时间和进展速度来对齐个体轨迹，在PPMI数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖离散、规则采样的数据，难以处理PD队列中不规则和稀疏的MRI数据，且难以捕捉个体异质性（如疾病发作时间、进展速度和症状严重程度的差异）。

Method: CNODE框架使用神经ODE模型将脑形态变化建模为连续时间过程，联合学习患者特异性初始时间和进展速度，将个体轨迹对齐到共享进展轨迹中。

Result: 在帕金森病进展标志物倡议(PPMI)数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在预测纵向PD进展方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: CNODE能够有效建模PD的异质性和演化性脑形态变化模式，为机制洞察、治疗开发和个体化数字孪生预测提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

Motivation: 现有工作建立了多校准与属性可引出性之间的重要联系，但[NR23]提出的在线算法效率较低，只能达到√T的ℓ_2-多校准误差。本文旨在改进这一结果，为更广泛的假设类和更强的多校准概念提供更高效的算法。

Method: 将多校准从群组成员函数推广到任意有界假设类，引入交换多校准概念。提出基于在线不可知学习器的预言机高效算法，利用假设类的有界顺序Rademacher复杂度和属性可引出性。

Result: 对于r≥2，算法以高概率实现T^{1/(r+1)}的ℓ_r-交换多校准误差。特别地，当r=2时，实现T^{1/3}的ℓ_2-交换多校准误差，显著改进了现有界限。

Conclusion: 本文完全解决了[GJRR24]中提出的开放性问题，以强肯定方式证明了存在预言机高效算法可以达到√T的ℓ_2-均值多校准误差，为多校准理论提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始ROC-SVM虽然能直接最大化AUC曲线下面积，在处理类别不平衡问题时具有优势，但其O(n²)的计算复杂度限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用不完全U统计量降低计算复杂度，并通过低秩核近似扩展到非线性分类，在再生核希尔伯特空间中进行高效训练。

Result: 理论分析建立了误差界限验证了所提近似的合理性，在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在显著减少训练时间的同时，达到了与原始ROC-SVM相当的AUC性能。

Conclusion: 提出的可扩展ROC-SVM变体成功解决了原始方法计算成本高的问题，为类别不平衡分类提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Motivation: 现有文献大多假设可以访问生成模型或预收集的数据集，绕过了探索的挑战。本文研究更现实和具有挑战性的设置，即智能体仅限于与训练环境进行在线交互。

Method: 引入最大访问比率来衡量训练动态与部署动态之间的不匹配，提出首个计算高效的算法，在基于f-散度的转移不确定性在线RMDP中实现次线性遗憾。

Result: 证明了如果最大访问比率无界，在线学习将变得指数级困难。提出的算法在最大访问比率和交互回合数上都实现了最优的遗憾依赖关系。

Conclusion: 通过全面的数值实验验证了理论结果，表明所提出的算法在在线离动态强化学习中具有优越性能。

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE模型因存储所有专家参数而导致的高内存开销问题，特别是在专家数量增加时，现有方法在高压缩比下存在性能下降。

Method: 采用双掩码识别权重冗余和专业化，进行稀疏专家合并；引入位打包编码方案重用未充分利用的指数位，避免存储二进制掩码和符号的开销。

Result: 在50%压缩率下，在MMLU任务上比现有方法提升16.7%，推理速度提升1.28倍，在各种任务上保持准确性。

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE能够有效压缩MoE模型，实现高精度和高效推理，解决了MoE模型部署中的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

Motivation: 现有TSFMs在不同预测任务、领域和时域上表现差异显著，但如何有效利用这种互补性进行仲裁仍是一个未充分探索的研究领域。

Method: 提出Synapse仲裁框架，动态管理TSFM池，基于上下文相关性能分配和调整预测权重，通过自适应采样组成模型的输出分位数来构建稳健的预测分布。

Result: 实验结果表明Synapse在时间序列预测中持续优于其他流行的集成技术以及单个TSFMs。

Conclusion: Synapse框架通过有效仲裁多个TSFMs的互补专业知识，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Method: 推导流匹配分布近似的KL散度的确定性非渐近上界，分析L2流匹配损失与KL散度的关系，并研究流匹配在总变差距离下的统计收敛率。

Result: 当L2流匹配损失有界于ε²时，真实数据分布与估计分布之间的KL散度有界于A₁ε + A₂ε²，其中常数A₁和A₂仅依赖于数据和速度场的正则性。

Conclusion: 流匹配在估计平滑分布时达到近乎极小极大最优效率，其统计效率与扩散模型在总变差距离下相当，数值研究验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat
antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent

approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these
challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial

peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial
peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations
into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on
ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average
Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

*Matthew S. Zhang,Stephen Huan,Jerry Huang,Nicholas M. Boffi,Sitan Chen,Sinho Chewi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SDE积分器DDRaM，通过随机中点方法改进DDPM采样，在适当平滑性假设下实现了亚线性复杂度收敛，这是首个纯DDPM采样的亚线性复杂度界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DDPM分析主要关注指数欧拉离散化，其保证通常至少线性依赖于维度或初始Fisher信息。受对数凹采样工作的启发，希望开发更高效的采样算法。

Method: 提出去噪扩散随机中点方法(DDRaM)，利用额外的随机中点来更好地逼近SDE。使用"移位组合规则"分析框架，在适当平滑性假设下分析该算法的离散化特性。

Result: DDRaM算法只需要亚线性O~(√d)次评分评估即可确保收敛，这是首个纯DDPM采样的亚线性复杂度界限。实验验证了该方法在实际预训练图像合成模型中的良好表现。

Conclusion: DDRaM算法在理论上实现了亚线性复杂度收敛，并在实践中表现出色，为DDPM采样提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型分析美国消费者对具有创新运输证书食品的偏好，重点关注运输安全、能源等证书对购买决策的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前研究发现运输因素在消费者食品购买选择中具有显著影响，需要进一步识别消费者重视的具体运输属性。

Method: 采用机器学习模型分析消费者偏好实验数据，提出五种创新运输证书：运输模式、物联网、安全措施、能源来源和必须到达日期，并控制产品和决策者因素。

Result: 研究发现美国消费者在食品供应链运输领域明显偏好安全和能源证书，同时价格、产品类型、证书和决策者因素都对购买选择产生影响。

Conclusion: 研究为改进食品供应链系统提供了数据驱动的建议，强调了运输安全和能源相关证书的重要性。

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两种互补策略来解决LLM智能体在新环境中的泛化问题：在线分布适应和部署时动态基础化，显著提升了智能体在复杂环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在未见过的复杂环境（如新网站或函数集）中泛化能力不足，主要由于预训练与测试条件不匹配，存在语法误解和语义误解两种失败模式。

Method: 1) 在线分布适应：学习轻量级适应向量来偏置模型输出分布，快速对齐环境响应格式；2) 部署时动态基础化：通过角色驱动探索阶段系统探测和学习环境因果动态，构建非参数世界模型。

Result: 在函数调用和网页导航等基准测试中，两种策略都有效且计算成本低。在WebArena多站点分割测试中，动态基础化方法将成功率从2%提升至23%。

Conclusion: 动态基础化在复杂环境中特别有效，为构建更通用和强大的LLM智能体提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

TL;DR: SigmaDock是一种基于SE(3)黎曼扩散模型的分子对接方法，通过分解配体为刚性片段并学习在结合口袋中重新组装这些片段，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式分子对接方法中存在的化学不合理输出、泛化性差和计算成本高等挑战。

Method: 提出新颖的片段化方案，将配体分解为刚性片段，然后使用SE(3)黎曼扩散模型学习在结合口袋中重新组装这些片段。

Result: 在PoseBusters数据集上达到79.9%的Top-1成功率（RMSD<2且PB有效），远超近期深度学习方法（12.7-30.8%），并展现出对未见蛋白质的一致泛化能力。

Conclusion: SigmaDock是首个在PB训练-测试分割下超越经典基于物理的对接方法的深度学习方法，标志着深度学习在分子建模可靠性和可行性方面的重大突破。

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

Method: 结合指数族先验和量子玻尔兹曼分布构建CSQBMs模型，利用解析梯度计算实现与Actor-Critic算法的直接集成，提出连续Q学习框架，用CSQBM分布的高效采样替代全局最大化。

Result: 开发出能够计算连续变量解析梯度的模型，实现了与Actor-Critic算法的无缝集成，构建了稳定的连续控制强化学习框架。

Conclusion: CSQBMs为连续动作强化学习提供了理论基础的解决方案，通过量子-经典混合模型有效减少了量子资源需求，同时解决了连续控制中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoodRL是一个基于强化学习的元学习框架，用于预测食品银行中高度波动的实物捐赠，通过动态加权多种预测模型来提高预测准确性，特别是在季节性变化和自然灾害等干扰时期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品银行在缓解粮食不安全方面至关重要，但传统预测模型难以应对实物捐赠的高度波动性和概念漂移问题，特别是在季节性变化和自然灾害（如飓风、野火）影响下。

Method: 提出FoodRL框架，使用强化学习进行元学习，基于近期表现和上下文信息对不同的预测模型进行聚类和动态加权。

Result: 在两个结构不同的美国食品银行（受野火影响的西海岸大型区域食品银行和受飓风影响的东海岸州级食品银行）的多年度数据评估中，FoodRL始终优于基线方法，特别是在中断或衰退时期。

Conclusion: FoodRL通过提供更可靠和自适应的预测，每年可促进相当于170万份额外餐食的食品重新分配，展示了其在人道主义供应链中自适应集成学习的巨大潜力和社会影响力。

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在混合自动驾驶交通系统中，自利型自动驾驶车辆是否能为所有驾驶主体带来集体利益，证明了通过深度强化学习训练的驾驶主体能够实现集体理性（CR），即在追求个体利益的同时实现集体合作。

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶汽车即将商业化，混合自动驾驶交通系统将包含自动驾驶车辆和人类驾驶车辆。虽然研究表明自动驾驶车辆可以通过系统级目标优化整体交通性能，但尚不清楚在驾驶主体都追求自利的情况下，这种效益是否依然存在。

Method: 使用深度强化学习（DRL）训练自利型交通主体，采用简单的奖励设计，不直接包含系统级目标，研究集体理性（CR）的实现程度。

Result: 在各种场景中，集体理性持续出现，表明这一特性的稳健性。研究还提出了解释微观动态环境中CR涌现的机制，并通过仿真证据进行了验证。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可以利用先进学习方法（如联邦学习）在混合自动驾驶系统中实现自利型驾驶主体的集体合作，为未来交通系统设计提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Conclusion: 通过课程学习和数据筛选的改进方法，为资源受限模型提供了更稳健的无监督强化学习路径，能够有效引导推理能力的提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

Conclusion: Craftax基准环境为MARL研究提供了有意义的挑战，有潜力推动该领域的长期发展。

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

Result: 研究发现知识泄漏在所有方法和任务中持续存在，表明当前最先进的遗忘技术只能提供有限的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 当前的大语言模型遗忘技术存在严重漏洞，迫切需要开发更鲁棒的遗忘方法。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

Conclusion: 建立了非渐近收敛保证，提供了基于轨迹的分析框架，证明了任意初始化的有限样本级收敛，为混合线性回归中EM算法分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAR-TS是一个用于多元时间序列生成的框架，通过解耦因子化和自回归Transformer在离散量化潜在空间中实现快速可控的任意长度序列生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的多元时间序列生成方法速度慢且仅限于固定长度窗口，需要更高效灵活的生成框架。

Method: 将时间序列分解为捕获静态跨通道相关性的数据自适应基和时序系数，后者被向量量化为离散标记，然后使用LLaMA风格的自回归Transformer建模这些标记序列。

Result: FAR-TS比Diffusion-TS快几个数量级，同时保持了跨通道相关性和可解释的潜在空间，实现了高质量灵活的时间序列合成。

Conclusion: FAR-TS提供了一种简单有效的多元时间序列生成方法，在速度和灵活性方面显著优于现有扩散方法。

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk
portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models,
neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such
as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these
"black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP.
Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models
and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be
applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME.
Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a
novel five dimensional framework evaluating Inherent Interpretability, Global
Explanations, Local Explanations, Consistency, and Complexity to offer a
nuanced method for assessing and comparing model explainability beyond simple
accuracy metrics. This research demonstrates the feasibility of employing
sophisticated, high performing ML models in regulated financial environments by
utilizing modern explainability techniques and provides a structured approach
to evaluate the crucial trade offs between model performance and
interpretability.

*Zhiqi Bu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了深度模型在训练过程中的渐进扩展策略，通过优化理论和特征学习视角，提出了零/一层渐进训练方法，可在几乎不损失性能的情况下显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型深度是深度学习的双刃剑：更深的模型能获得更高精度但需要更高计算成本。为了高效训练大规模模型，需要找到在训练过程中扩展模型容量的有效策略。

Method: 通过优化理论和特征学习视角研究深度扩展，提出零/一层渐进训练方法，关注新层初始化、超参数迁移、学习率调度和模型扩展时机。

Result: 在GPT2上应用零/一层渐进训练可节省约80%计算量，或等效加速约5倍，同时达到与完全训练的60层模型几乎相同的损失。

Conclusion: 渐进训练是平衡计算成本和模型性能的有效策略，零/一层渐进训练在GPT2上展示了显著的计算效率提升。

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个综合混合框架，结合结构断点检测、小波信号去噪和三种深度学习模型，用于碳价格预测，显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测碳价格对能源市场决策至关重要，但由于政策干预和市场冲击导致的结构断点和高频噪声，现有方法存在局限性，需要更鲁棒和通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出综合混合框架，集成结构断点检测（Bai-Perron、ICSS和PELT算法）、小波信号去噪以及三种先进深度学习模型（LSTM、GRU和TCN），使用2007-2024年欧盟配额现货价格数据和外部特征。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的PELT-WT-TCN模型在预测精度上表现最佳，与最先进的基线模型相比，RMSE降低22.35%，MAE降低18.63%；与原始LSTM相比，RMSE降低70.55%，MAE降低74.42%。

Conclusion: 将结构意识和多尺度分解集成到深度学习架构中，能显著提高碳价格预测和其他非平稳金融时间序列的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于Transformer的深度学习模型在处理电子健康记录时面临的时间依赖性问题，包括不规则就诊间隔和缺乏统一结构。

Method: 开发Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder (BiPETE)，整合旋转位置嵌入编码相对就诊时间和正弦嵌入保持就诊顺序，在两个心理健康队列上训练预测ASUD风险。

Result: BiPETE在抑郁和PTSD队列中分别将AUPRC提升了34%和50%，消融研究证实双位置编码策略的有效性，通过集成梯度方法识别关键临床特征。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个实用且可解释的疾病风险预测框架，能够实现强性能，识别出的关键临床特征有助于深入理解风险评估过程并为风险缓解提供线索。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAC-Flow是一个简单而表达力强的多智能体协调框架，通过流式表示学习联合行为，并将其蒸馏为去中心化的一步策略，解决了性能与计算成本之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有效协调的两个要求之间存在权衡：扩散方法能捕捉复杂协调但计算慢，高斯策略方法快但处理多智能体交互脆弱。MAC-Flow旨在同时满足这两个要求。

Method: 首先学习基于流的联合行为表示，然后将其蒸馏为去中心化的一步策略，既保持协调能力又实现快速执行。

Result: 在4个基准测试、12个环境和34个数据集上，MAC-Flow实现了约14.5倍于扩散方法的推理速度提升，同时保持良好性能，推理速度与高斯策略方法相当。

Conclusion: MAC-Flow有效缓解了多智能体协调中性能与计算成本之间的权衡问题，提供了一种既高效又具有表达力的协调框架。

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OvA-LP是一个联邦微调框架，通过线性探测和一对多头设计，在源头抑制客户端数据分布不均导致的局部漂移问题，在极端非IID条件下保持95.9%的IID准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦微调方法在异构客户端分布下容易受到局部漂移影响，导致全局模型出现系统性偏差和方差放大，现有的事后校正方法在极端非IID条件下表现脆弱。

Method: OvA-LP结合冻结编码器上的线性探测和一对多头设计，采用两阶段过程，保持预训练特征几何结构并解耦逻辑值，防止漂移放大机制。

Result: 在CIFAR-100数据集上，OvA-LP在极端非IID条件下保持95.9%的IID准确率，显著优于PFPT(10.1%)和FFT-MoE(34.5%)等先进基线方法，且在对称和非对称标签噪声下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OvA-LP为异构环境下的联邦微调提供了一个有原则且高效的基础框架，通过预计算编码器特征使每轮成本几乎与编码器大小无关。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Motivation: 现有的偏好优化方法忽略了候选解生成和评估的成本，且未考虑人类专家反馈中的感知模糊性，这在实际应用中限制了效率。

Method: 提出连续偏好贝叶斯优化，约束比较仅使用已生成的候选解以降低生产成本；引入可感知差异阈值到概率偏好模型中，捕捉对小效用差异的漠视；采用信息论获取策略选择最具信息量的新配置。

Result: 实证研究表明，在高生产成本或存在漠视反馈的设置中，该方法显著提高了优化准确性。

Conclusion: 连续偏好贝叶斯优化通过显式考虑生产和评估成本以及人类反馈的感知模糊性，有效提升了偏好优化在实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了实验室、影像和多模态深度学习模型在预测PRRT治疗患者无进展生存期(PFS)方面的表现，发现结合SR-PET、CT和实验室生物标志物的多模态融合模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肽受体放射性核素治疗(PRRT)是转移性神经内分泌肿瘤的标准治疗方法，但只有部分患者能获得长期疾病控制。预测PFS有助于个体化治疗规划。

Method: 回顾性单中心研究纳入116名接受177Lu-DOTATOC治疗的转移性NET患者。收集临床特征、实验室值和治疗前SR-PET/CT影像。训练了7个模型，包括单模态(实验室、SR-PET或CT)和多模态融合方法。

Result: 多模态融合模型(结合实验室值、SR-PET和CT，并增强预训练CT分支)获得最佳结果(AUROC 0.72±0.01，AUPRC 0.80±0.01)，优于单模态方法。

Conclusion: 结合SR-PET、CT和实验室生物标志物的多模态深度学习在PRRT后PFS预测方面优于单模态方法，经外部验证后可能支持风险适应性随访策略。

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Motivation: NatureLM作为生物声学领域的基座模型，在领域特定微调后虽然表现出色，但在指令跟随灵活性方面存在不足，特别是当同时请求多个信息时性能下降。

Method: 应用简单的模型融合策略，将NatureLM与其基础语言模型进行插值，以恢复指令跟随能力。

Result: 融合后的模型在保持领域专业知识的同时，显著提升了指令跟随能力，并在零样本分类上实现了超过200%的相对改进，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 模型融合策略是解决领域特定微调与指令跟随灵活性之间权衡的有效方法，能够在保持专业性能的同时提升模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

Motivation: 生成模型如Stable Diffusion和ChatGPT的广泛应用使其成为恶意利用的目标，现有投毒攻击要么导致生成数据质量普遍下降，要么需要控制训练过程，限制了实际应用。

Method: 关联性投毒攻击仅扰动训练数据，通过操纵统计关联来影响生成数据的细粒度特征，提供了正式数学公式并证明了理论可行性和隐蔽性。

Result: 在两个最先进生成模型上的实证评估表明，关联性投毒能有效诱导或抑制特征关联，同时保持目标特征的边缘分布和高质量输出，从而逃避视觉检测。

Conclusion: 生成系统在图像合成、合成数据集生成和自然语言处理中容易受到这种隐蔽操纵，威胁其统计完整性，需要新的防御策略来应对这一风险。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

Motivation: iRBD是α-突触核蛋白病的重要前驱标志，腕戴式活动记录仪在大规模筛查中具有潜力，但需要可靠高效的分析流程。

Method: 开发包含稳健预处理和自动睡眠-觉醒检测的流程，提取生理可解释的运动特征，使用机器学习模型识别RBD。

Result: 在78人队列中AUROC达0.95，在盲测集（n=31）和两个独立外部队列（n=113, n=57）中分别达到0.86、0.84和0.94的AUROC。

Conclusion: ActiTect作为开源工具促进广泛采用，推动使用可穿戴设备建立统一且可泛化的RBD检测模型。

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

Result: 实验表明该框架不仅达到最先进精度，更重要的是实现了个体层面的高保真反事实推理。

Conclusion: 该工作为现代生成模型与经典因果理论的结合提供了基础蓝图，为这一新兴领域建立了更严格的标准。

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于解决卡车-无人机协同旅行商问题（TSP-D）的分层Actor-Critic深度强化学习框架，包含Transformer编码器和最小门控单元解码器，在训练效率和求解质量上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡车-无人机协同系统在最后一公里物流中展现出巨大潜力，但TSP-D问题具有NP-hard组合复杂性，传统优化方法难以有效解决。深度强化学习提供了通过自监督策略学习和自适应决策来应对这一挑战的理论基础。

Method: 提出分层Actor-Critic深度强化学习框架，包含两个主要组件：采用优化的k近邻稀疏注意力机制的Transformer编码器，用于聚焦相关空间关系；最小门控单元解码器，用于高效生成解序列。整个框架在异步优势Actor-Critic范式下运行。

Result: 在基准TSP-D实例（N=10到100）上的实验结果表明，与高性能启发式算法和现有强化学习方法相比，所提模型能在更短的平均计算时间内获得竞争性甚至更优的解。与先进强化学习算法基准相比，显著减少了总训练时间，同时实现了更优的最终性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在训练效率和求解性能方面均表现出显著优势，为复杂物流优化问题提供了有效的深度强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了加速路径修补（APP）方法，通过对比性注意力头剪枝技术大幅减少电路发现的计算成本，相比传统路径修补方法提速59.63%-93.27%，同时保持电路性能相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电路发现方法（如路径修补）计算成本高，限制了在小模型上的深入电路分析，需要更高效的电路发现方法。

Method: 提出混合方法APP：首先使用新颖的对比性注意力头剪枝方法（Contrastive-FLAP）减少搜索空间，然后对剩余注意力头应用传统路径修补。

Result: APP平均减少56%的搜索空间，提速59.63%-93.27%，获得的电路与已有路径修补电路有显著重叠且性能相似。

Conclusion: APP在保持电路性能的同时大幅降低了计算成本，为机制可解释性研究提供了更高效的电路发现工具。

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

Motivation: 在涉及电子健康记录的时间序列预测任务中，平衡强隐私保护和高预测性能至关重要。需要找到既能保护隐私又不牺牲模型性能的方法。

Method: 研究了多种数据增强策略：零阶优化（ZOO）、基于主成分分析的ZOO变体（ZOO-PCA）和MixUp方法，通过重新训练模型使用合成数据来增强模型对成员推理攻击的抵抗力。

Result: 实验结果显示，ZOO-PCA方法在保持测试数据性能的同时，对成员推理攻击的TPR/FPR比率实现了最佳降低效果。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是ZOO-PCA方法可以有效减轻时间序列预测模型的成员推理攻击风险，在保护隐私和维持性能之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

*Jatin Prakash,Aahlad Puli,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAT是一种高效的Transformer架构，通过压缩和分块注意力机制，在保持质量的同时显著降低计算和内存需求，支持测试时自适应调整质量-计算权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效注意力方法（稀疏注意力、滑动窗口、卷积等）往往需要在质量和效率之间权衡，且需要复杂的启发式设计或混合架构。这些方法无法在测试时灵活调整质量-计算权衡，限制了实际应用的适应性。

Method: 提出Compress & Attend Transformer (CAT)，仅使用密集注意力和压缩两个简单组件。通过将序列分块并压缩历史块，在解码时从压缩后的序列中提取信息，实现计算和内存节省。支持多分块大小训练，实现测试时自适应调整。

Result: 在语言建模、上下文回忆和长上下文理解任务中，单一自适应CAT模型在不同计算-内存预算下均优于现有高效基线，包括混合架构。与密集Transformer相比，CAT在保持相同语言建模性能的同时，速度提升1.4-3倍，总内存使用减少2-9倍。

Conclusion: CAT提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，通过压缩和分块注意力机制实现了质量与效率的良好平衡，支持测试时灵活调整，为高效Transformer架构设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖方法，通过在商品图像上直接渲染相关文本内容（如标题、描述）来执行视觉-文本压缩，从而增强图像-文本对齐并提升多模态商品检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中的多模态商品检索系统需要有效结合视觉和文本信号来提高搜索相关性和用户体验，但像CLIP这样的视觉语言模型容易受到排版攻击的影响，其中嵌入图像的误导性或无关文本会扭曲模型预测。

Method: 通过将相关文本内容（标题、描述等）直接渲染到商品图像上，实现视觉-文本压缩，从而强化图像-文本对齐。在三个垂直电商数据集（运动鞋、手提包和交易卡）上使用六种最先进的视觉基础模型进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，在各类别和模型家族中，单模态和多模态检索准确性均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 在商品图像上视觉渲染产品元数据是电商应用中零样本多模态检索的一种简单而有效的增强方法。

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从输入-输出数据学习动力学模型，无需速度或动量数据，同时保持物理一致性并提供不确定性量化。

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配规划方法缺乏对状态约束、动作约束和动态一致性的形式化保证，这在实际应用中可能影响轨迹的安全性和可执行性。

Method: 提出SAD-Flower框架，通过增强流中的虚拟控制输入，利用非线性控制理论推导原则性指导，为约束满足提供形式化保证。

Result: 在多个任务上的实验表明，SAD-Flower在确保约束满足方面优于各种基于生成模型的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAD-Flower能够生成安全、可接受且动态一致的轨迹，无需重新训练即可满足未见约束，为数据驱动规划提供了可靠的约束保证。

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: 证明了持续学习在智能电网可扩展、实际故障预测中的实用性。

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under

approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology

Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these

Result: 广泛实验表明，SoilX相比基线方法将估计误差降低了23.8%至31.5%，并且在未见过的农田中具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SoilX通过显式建模有机碳和铝硅酸盐，成功消除了土壤质地和碳依赖的重新校准需求，为精准农业提供了实用的土壤监测解决方案。

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an explosion in statistical learning literature to
represent data using topological principles to capture structure and
relationships. We propose a topological data analysis (TDA)-based framework,
named Topological Prototype Selector (TPS), for selecting representative
subsets (prototypes) from large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
TPS on simulated data under different data intrinsic characteristics, and
compare TPS against other currently used prototype selection methods in real
data settings. In all simulated and real data settings, TPS significantly
preserves or improves classification performance while substantially reducing
data size. These contributions advance both algorithmic and geometric aspects
of prototype learning and offer practical tools for parallelized,
interpretable, and efficient classification.

Abstract: In this study, a scalable online kernel learning framework is proposed for
estimating bidirectional causal effects in systems characterized by mutual
dependence and heteroskedasticity. Traditional causal inference often focuses
on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships
in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification,
the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for
simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It
employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear
conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent
algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional
data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial
approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error
across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the
proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects
with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification
with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal
inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial
applications.

Abstract: Convex clustering is a well-regarded clustering method, resembling the
similar centroid-based approach of Lloyd's $k$-means, without requiring a
predefined cluster count. It starts with each data point as its centroid and
iteratively merges them. Despite its advantages, this method can fail when
dealing with data exhibiting linearly non-separable or non-convex structures.
To mitigate the limitations, we propose a kernelized extension of the convex
clustering method. This approach projects the data points into a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a feature map, enabling convex clustering in
this transformed space. This kernelization not only allows for better handling
of complex data distributions but also produces an embedding in a
finite-dimensional vector space. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
underpinnings for our kernelized approach, proving algorithmic convergence and
establishing finite sample bounds for our estimates. The effectiveness of our
method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
clustering techniques. This work marks a significant advancement in the field,
offering an effective solution for clustering in non-linear and non-convex data
scenarios.

Abstract: Geotechnical reports are crucial for assessing the stability of rock
formations and ensuring safety in modern engineering. Traditionally, these
reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses,
magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and
subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of
artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of
reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was
based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with
their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the
Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report
outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large
language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and
specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be
an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The
system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and
ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are
comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an
intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats,
represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and
students of field geology.
