Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation.

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence.

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8616\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u6216\u88c1\u526a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u8fa8\u522b\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u540c\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u62c9\u8fd1\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdc\u79bb\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CIFAR10\u3001CIFAR100\u3001Caltech-101\u3001Caltech-256\u3001ImageNet\u3001BiasedMNIST\u3001UTKFace\u3001CelebA\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd416\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728BiasedMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8622.9%\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

Existing theoretical methods assume that downstream task classes are drawn from the same latent class distribution used during the pretraining phase. However, in real-world settings, downstream tasks may not only exhibit distributional shifts within the same label space but also introduce new or broader label spaces, leading to domain generalization challenges. In this work, we introduce novel generalization bounds that explicitly account for both types of mismatch: domain shift and domain generalization. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where downstream tasks either (i) draw classes from the same latent class space but with shifted distributions, or (ii) involve new label spaces beyond those seen during pretraining. Our analysis reveals how the performance of contrastively learned representations depends on the statistical discrepancy between pretraining and downstream distributions. This extended perspective allows us to derive provable guarantees on the performance of learned representations on average classification tasks involving class distributions outside the pretraining latent class set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u76f8\u540c\u6f5c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f46\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff1b2\uff09\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6d89\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u6d89\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u96c6\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5VLM\u80fd\u5426\u8bc6\u522bT2I\u6a21\u578b\u572827\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b5\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3\u4e2aVLM\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u786e\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u6307\u5b9a\u989c\u8272\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u5176\u9700\u8981\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30T2I\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLM\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5VLM\u80fd\u5426\u8bc6\u522bT2I\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u768427\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b5\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\uff08Flux\u3001SD3-Medium\u3001SD3-Large\u3001SD3.5-Medium\u3001SD3.5-Large\uff09\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u548c3\u4e2aVLM\uff08Molmo\u3001InternVL3\u3001Pixtral\uff09\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\uff08Llama3\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1VLM\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u5fae\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30T2I\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLM\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference.

Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision.

Ng", "Duncan Watson-Parris"], "title": "Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flow Matching for Climate Emulation", "comment": null, "summary": "Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions.

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type.

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "CCD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5373\u65f6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6216\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\uff08CCD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5e8f\u5217\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u65e9\u671f\u62d2\u7edd\u6b21\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728Dream\u548cLLaDA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe3.48\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c3.91%\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "CCD\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489).

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "MRD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5c0f\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684RAG\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5757\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c0f\u5757\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5c06\u5b8c\u6574\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5757\u4e2d\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMRD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MRD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL).

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations. This property allows for a drastic reduction in memory consumption, allowing for the processing of larger batch sizes for the same available memory, thereby offering improved throughput. In addition, we propose an efficient method for converting existing, non-reversible LLMs into reversible architectures through fine-tuning, rendering our approach practical for exploiting existing pre-trained models.

We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "AI": {"tldr": "UniFact\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff08\u770b\u4f3c\u6d41\u7545\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e24\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniFact\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6ca1\u6709\u54ea\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b2) \u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff1b3) \u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd8\u9996\u6b21\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u4f55\u5206\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u6574\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models.

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\uff08DI\uff09\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u97f3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u521d\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540cMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u4ee5Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u516d\u79cd\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u5b50\u65b9\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1173.25%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u548cPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ada-MoGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u5e03\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9891\u7387\u53d1\u751f\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u592a\u5c11\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u592a\u591a\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAda-MoGE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u9891\u5e26\u622a\u65ad\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752820\u4e07\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "Ada-MoGE\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $\u0398((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods.

While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis.

Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u6784\u7b49\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\u67b6\u6784\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5236\u7ea6\u5f53\u4ee3AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u6574\u5408AI\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f53\u524dAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e03\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u5f81\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5728\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u7ec8\u8eab\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3002\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684AI\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cdAI\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6709\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u914d\u5907\u6539\u9769\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u6027\u5e76\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684Gaussian\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Gaussian\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u624d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u5757\u5185\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u73b0\u6709\u7684Gaussian\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u5757\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86Gaussian\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684Gaussian\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709Gaussian\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u4eba\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u53d6\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b0\u8bdd\u8bed\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u8868\u793a\u548c\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u4e60\u5f97\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e60\u5f97\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u6027\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\u3002\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u513f\u7ae5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MODOMA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%.

A model's ability to generate such traces can be optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve their utility in predicting an answer. This optimization comes at a high computational cost, especially for narrative-related tasks that involve retrieving and processing many tokens. To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiteReason\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\"\u8df3\u8fc7\"\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6765\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u5927\u91cf\u4ee4\u724c\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLiteReason\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u8df3\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362", "result": "\u5728\u60c5\u8282\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e66\u7c4d\u7ae0\u8282\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cLiteReason\u4f18\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u6f5c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1177-92%", "conclusion": "LiteReason\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fbe\u5230\u6027\u80fd-\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u8861\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c"}}

This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments.

Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniGuard\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08OLLMs\uff09\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u65f6\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u62a4\u680f\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOmniGuard\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6df1\u601d\u719f\u8651\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc721\u4e07\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u84b8\u998f\u4ece\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOmniGuard\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniGuard\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring.

However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases.

Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6784\u5efaMMO\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMMO\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5e72\u6270\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7b80\u5316\u79bb\u7ebf\u4eff\u771f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u53cd\u5e94", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53MMO\u4eff\u771f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a1) \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u4ece\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u9002\u5e94\u5230\u6e38\u620f\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6e38\u620f\u65e5\u5fd7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73a9\u5bb6\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u6846\u67b6", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfMMO\u6e38\u620f\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f53\u9a8c"}}

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u624d\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5929\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9002\u5408\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u533a\u5206\u96be\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u7ec6\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8fd1\u671f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u591a6\u4e2a\u70b9\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u884d\u751f\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u76f8\u540c\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5f62\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5929\u751f\u5305\u542b\u9002\u5408\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8637\u4e2aLLM\u57289\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8eLLM\u6c42\u89e3\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u540c\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752837\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u57fa\u7840vs\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u57289\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u6307\u6807\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765LLM\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fdAI\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u9690\u542b\u7b49\u4ef7\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc6\u522b\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u9690\u542b\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fdAI\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u5408\u7ea6\u6587\u672c\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c06\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u7ec4\u5230\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u7fa4\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u8bc6\u522b\u7fa4\u5185\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f8\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728Polymarket\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u667a\u80fdAI\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea660-70%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u4ea4\u6613\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5468\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u83b7\u5f97\u7ea620%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fdAI\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer.

Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "R-Few\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u6f14\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5e73\u53f0\u671f\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR-Few\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6311\u6218\u8005-\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u81ea\u5bf9\u5f08\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6311\u6218\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u793a\u4f8b\u6307\u5bfc\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u96be\u5ea6\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0b\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u5408\u6210\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cR-Few\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cQwen3-8B-Base\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4R-Zero\u63d0\u53473.0\u5206\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f7f\u752820\u500d\u4eba\u5de5\u6570\u636e\u7684General-Reasoner\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "R-Few\u901a\u8fc7\u63a5\u5730\u6c14\u7684\u6311\u6218\u8005\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality.

Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries.

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field. We release splits and code where possible and provide guidance for metric selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4e49\u654f\u611f\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u5e94\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528EVONS\u548cFakeNewsNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff08RoBERTa\u548cMistral\uff09\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7c89\u4e1d\u6570\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u70b9\u8d5e\u6570\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff08GRU\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u67b6\u6784\u3001Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u964d\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\uff08t-SNE\u548cPCA\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u964d\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002RoBERTa\u548cMistral\u5d4c\u5165\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f20\u64ad\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAPI\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources.

While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups.

Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65e0\u5730\u56fe\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u57df\u3001\u7a7a\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7684\u591a\u57df\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5197\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u52a0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u57df\u3001\u7a7a\u57df\u548c\u9891\u57df\u7684\u591a\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff1b2. \u5728\u65f6\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408(MoE)\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\uff1b3. \u63d0\u53d6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u91cf\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65f6\u57df\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b5. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u548c\u70b9\u7ea7\u635f\u5931\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u5408\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Nuscences\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65e0\u5730\u56fe\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57df\u5904\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fe1\u606f\u7b5b\u9009\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We show that in the \\emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.\n  We give a general reduction from sample-based \\emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.\n  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e03\u5c14\u6982\u5ff5\u7c7b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bc1\u4f2a\u5f52\u7ea6\u5230\u5e26\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0ePAC\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5e38\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728Rubinfeld\u548cVasilyan\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u662f\u5426\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u5e03\u5c14\u6982\u5ff5\u7c7b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u8bc1\u4f2a\u5230\u5e26\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5f52\u7ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5229\u7528[KL18]\u4e2d\u4ece\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u6765\u83b7\u5f97TL-Q\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b3. \u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u7c7b\"\u7edf\u8ba1\"\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u5b50\u7acb\u65b9\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff1b4. \u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u7c7bTL-Q\u7b97\u6cd5\u610f\u5473\u7740\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc1\u4f2a\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73m\u6837\u672cPAC\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8d85\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5730\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b2. \u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7684SQ\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\uff1b3. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5e26\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc1\u4f2a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d85\u8d8a\u6837\u672c\u4ec5\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u5b9a\u6210\u5458\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAGE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5230\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "SAGE\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6784\u5efa\u6e90\u57df\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u683c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u534f\u8c03\u56fe\u50cf\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u95ed\u73af\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u57df\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Such approaches compute an advantage value for each sample, reflecting better or worse performance than expected, thereby yielding both positive and negative signals for training.

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8861\u91cf\u7b49\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u57283D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5c0a\u91cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce83D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7531\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5360\u6bd4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u3001\u529b\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u53bb\u566a\uff09\u4e2d\u76843D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5c06\u7b49\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u22642%\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u57281k-10k\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b66\u4e603D\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u6bd4\u4e3b\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u3002\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u635f\u5931\u60e9\u7f5a\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u635f\u5931\uff08\u6309GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e603D\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u7f29\u5c0f\"\u6548\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u7b49\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b49\u53d8\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages.

This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAM-OL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u53bb\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c0f\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5f53\u524d\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7ebf\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAM-OL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fc7\u53bb\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c0f\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5f53\u524d\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u5f53\u524d\u793a\u4f8b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u6734\u7d20\u91cd\u653e\u53d8\u4f53\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u91cd\u653e\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u7a97\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u90bb\u5c45\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5468\u671f\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0a\uff0cRAM-OL\u5c06\u9884\u5e8f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea67\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u5728\u5608\u6742\u7684\u822a\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0a\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0e\u7eaf\u5728\u7ebf\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u662f\u5904\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u7528\u76f8\u5173\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u8fc7\u65f6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff08\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u6df1\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5b50\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u66ff\u6362\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u5e03\u5c14\u4ee3\u6570\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8fc5\u901f\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9012\u5f52\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ef4\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5806\u6808\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5c42\u5d4c\u5957\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5b9a\u4f4d\u66ff\u6362\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9012\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice. These results highlight the potential of model merging algorithms for bias mitigation, while indicating that excessive debiasing or inappropriate merging methods may lead to the degradation of important linguistic abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf97\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u8f7bLLM\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dSLERP\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u7ee7\u627f\u751a\u81f3\u653e\u5927\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5a01\u80c1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u4e867\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Linear\u3001Karcher Mean\u3001SLERP\u3001NuSLERP\u3001TIES\u3001DELLA\u3001Nearswap\uff09\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGPT\u3001LLaMA\u548cQwen\u5bb6\u65cf\u768413\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u75283\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08BBQ\u3001BOLD\u3001HONEST\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SuperGLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9605\u8bfb\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u5728\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0cLinear\u3001SLERP\u548cNearswap\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e2d\u7b49\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u7684SLERP\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u5316\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9000\u5316\u3002SLERP\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u63d2\u503c\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%.

By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings.

Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecPV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206KV\u72b6\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u957f\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u52a0\u901f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6700\u76f4\u63a5\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpecPV\u81ea\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u952e\u503c\u72b6\u6001\uff08KV\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u671f\u5e94\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u7d2f\u79ef\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecLLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct\u548cQwen3\u7cfb\u5217\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cSpecPV\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecPV\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206KV\u72b6\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u5b8c\u5168\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling.

Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \\emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

While recent works focus on developing new generation pipelines, how to evaluate such complex systems remains a significant challenge. To this end, we introduce SurveyEval, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates automatically generated surveys across three dimensions: overall quality, outline coherence, and reference accuracy. We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment. Evaluation results show that while general long-text or paper-writing systems tend to produce lower-quality surveys, specialized survey-generation systems are able to deliver substantially higher-quality results.

We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $\u03b2\\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state.

While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "StockMem\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u53cd\u601d\u53cc\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u5e73\u6574\u5408\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53cd\u601d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u80a1\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u5e02\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u65b0\u95fb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u901a\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4ef7\u683c\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStockMem\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u53cd\u601d\u53cc\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u65b0\u95fb\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u6c34\u5e73\u6574\u5408\u6574\u5408\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1b3\uff09\u7eb5\u5411\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6355\u6349\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6f14\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u53cd\u6620\u5e02\u573a\u9884\u671f\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b4\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff1b5\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5386\u53f2\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f53\u524d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eStockMem\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u94fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "StockMem\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants.

While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $\u03bd_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $\u0398$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $\u03ba$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.\n  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $\u03ba> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.\n  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u6a21\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c06AAI\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u6a21\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7531\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90r\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u03bd_r\uff0c\u7531\u9012\u5f52\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668-\u66f4\u65b0\u5668(GVU)\u7b97\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6d41\u5f62\u0398\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u5411\u91cf\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u6570\u03ba\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\u6cdb\u51fd\u6cbf\u6b64\u6d41\u7684\u674e\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u6570\u03ba>0\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\uff1a\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u8db3\u591f\u5c0f\u3002\u5c06\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u7ea0\u6b63\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86STaR\u3001SPIN\u3001Reflexion\u3001GANs\u548cAlphaZero\u7b49\u67b6\u6784\u90fd\u662f\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684GVU\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4e3a\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8c31\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aGVU\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings.

However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\\% and 13\\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents.

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bLightHCG\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79efVAE\u7684\u6781\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u533a\u57df\u5185\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u9752\u5149\u773c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u91ce\u68c0\u67e5\u3001\u89c6\u76d8\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u773c\u538b\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u867d\u7136AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u3001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "LightHCG\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHSIC\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6781\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79efVAE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eInceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u548cVGG16\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLightHCG\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8693~99%\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LightHCG\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u9a71\u52a8\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines.

Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \\textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ynamics- and \\textbf{\\underline{V}}alue-aligned \\textbf{\\underline{D}}ata \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions.

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time.

However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's \"Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment\" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT.

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization.

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech.

Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784TabGRU\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u5fae\u6ce2\u94fe\u8def\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u745e\u5178\u54e5\u5fb7\u5821\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u53d1\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5efa\u8bbe\u97e7\u6027\u667a\u6167\u57ce\u5e02\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u5fae\u6ce2\u94fe\u8def\u964d\u96e8\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aTabGRU\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u534f\u540c\u6355\u6349CML\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u745e\u5178\u54e5\u5fb7\u5821\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u752812\u4e2a\u5b50\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u96e8\u91cf\u8ba1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u671f\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7ea610\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002TabGRU\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1aTorp\u7ad9\u70b9R\u00b2=0.91\uff0cBarl\u7ad9\u70b9R\u00b2=0.96\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5cf0\u503c\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "TabGRU\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eCML\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728CML\u964d\u96e8\u53cd\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDROCO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u53cc\u91cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u8de8\u57dfBellman\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u8de8\u57dfBellman\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u548cHuber\u635f\u5931\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9RCB\u7b97\u5b50\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u6216\u4f4e\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f62\u6210DROCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDROCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DROCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u6700\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u793e\u533a\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e00\u6837\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3002nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u521b\u5efa\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u5b66\u672f\u51fa\u7248\u7269\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63ed\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672cnuImages\u548cPanoptic nuScenes\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e86nuScenes\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5982\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u81f3\u4eca\u4ecd\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4f17\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "nuScenes\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6db5\u76d6\u4e24\u5927\u6d32\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5b83\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cc\u7a0b\u7891\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u4e49\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9nuScenes\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672c\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u548c\u975e\u5b98\u65b9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6587\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u3002"}}

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u53475-10%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u82f1\u8bed\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4e3a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8c03\u8282\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u56db\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\uff09\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc71000\u4e07\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u5355\u5143\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u5982CoT\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\uff09\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u884c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u53475-10%\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the grow- ing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under- represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official base- lines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vec- tor Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and De- cision Tree as baseline methods. We also uti- lized transformer-based models such as Dis- tilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM- RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed base- line methods for the subtasks, except for Distil- BERT. Among the transformer-based models, BanglaBERT produces the best performance for both subtasks. Despite being smaller in size, BanglaBERT outperforms both m-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, which suggests language- specific pre-training is very important.

However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\\tilde{\\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\\tilde{\\oo}(\u03b4^{-1}\u03b5^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization.

In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\\&A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u95ed\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u63d0\u4f9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e7b\u89c9\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e38\u89c4\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u95ee\u7b54\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8c\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u65ad\u8a00\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u771f\u5b9e\u6765\u6e90\u94fe\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u793a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u89c6\u56fe\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5f31\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ea0\u6b63\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Water is used in agriculture for fertigation, for animal husbandry, and in the agrifood processing industry. In the context of the progressive digitalization of this sector, the automatic assessment of the quality of water is thus becoming an important asset. In this work, we present the integration of Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy with Machine Learning in the context of water quality assessment aiming at ensuring water safety and the compliance of water regulation. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of model interpretability by employing SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to understand the contribution of absorbance at different wavelengths to the predictions.

Code and data available at https://github.com/sandroandric/LLMs_Altruism_Study_Code", "summary": "We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models \"know\" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This \"virtue signaling gap\" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5229\u4ed6\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5185\u9690\u5173\u8054\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u80fd\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u5229\u4ed6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\"\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5dee\u8ddd\"\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5229\u4ed6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5229\u4ed6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u5229\u4ed6\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u5185\u9690\u5173\u8054\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u62a5\u544a\u80fd\u5426\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd524\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1) \u5185\u9690\u8054\u60f3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d4b\u91cf\u5185\u9690\u5229\u4ed6\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2) \u5f3a\u5236\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u5229\u4ed6\uff1b3) \u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u8868\u6d4b\u91cf\u663e\u6027\u5229\u4ed6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u70c8\u5185\u9690\u4eb2\u5229\u4ed6\u504f\u89c1\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5229\u4ed6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b3) \u5185\u9690\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b4) \u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9ad8\u4f30\u81ea\u8eab\u5229\u4ed6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\"\u7f8e\u5fb7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\"\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u8ddd\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u81ea\u6211\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "STL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u5148\u770b\u540e\u60f3\"\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8ba9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u8d1f\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u5ffd\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSee-Think-Learn\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5148\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\"\u770b\"\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff08\"\u60f3\"\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff1b3\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u8d1f\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u67d0\u4e9b\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSTL\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5176\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "STL\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy. By turning genuine confidence stabilization into computational savings, SchED makes dLLM decoding substantially more efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "SchED\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u5168\u8de8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6570\u8fb9\u9645\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSchED\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff1b2\uff09\u805a\u5408\u5168\u8de8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6570\u8fb9\u9645\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u505c\u6b62\u89e3\u7801\uff1b4\uff09\u5f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b03.8-4.0\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630199.8-100%\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u52a0\u901f\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u630199.1-100%\uff0c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe2.34\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5728\u60e9\u7f5a\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u901f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08QPS, \u03b3=4\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cSchED\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SchED\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u4f7fdLLM\u89e3\u7801\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u7684\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u516c\u5e73\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DMTFL\uff09\u7684VR\u89c6\u9891\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u57fa\u7ad9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u573a\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebfVR\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u7ebfVR\u4f53\u9a8c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u548c\u57fa\u7ad9\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDMTFL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ad9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Rademacher\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548cPAC\u8fb9\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u53d1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9eVR\u5934\u90e8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eDMTFL\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DMTFL\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ebfVR\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024.

However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning.

Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoCoP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ba1\u9053\uff08MoCoP\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u5c42\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(i)\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c(ii)\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c(iii)\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4-Turbo\u548cDeepSeek\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoCoP\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6bd2\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u5173\u7cfb\uff08rET = -0.81, p < 0.001\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u5173\uff08rEL \u2248 0\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002MoCoP\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u5185\u7701\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5ba1\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\\it cuBLAS}, {\\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\\% over {\\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\\% over {\\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\\% over {\\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\\% over the most competitive {\\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\\%, +26.0\\%, +22.4\\%, and +15.9\\% for {\\it torch.matmul}, {\\it cuBLAS}, {\\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "WorldPack\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6253\u5305\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWorldPack\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u8f68\u8ff9\u6253\u5305\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6548\u7387\uff1b2\uff09\u5185\u5b58\u68c0\u7d22\u4fdd\u6301rollout\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u957f\u671f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684Minecraft\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5LoopNav\u4e0a\uff0cWorldPack\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldPack\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.", "AI": {"tldr": "GoRL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e2\u7a33\u5b9a\u53c8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6765\u5408\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u6613\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u63a7\u5236\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u9ad8\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5f62\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6216\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u94fe\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u68af\u5ea6\u800c\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "GoRL\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\"\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6765\u5408\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5219\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f3c\u7136\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cGoRL\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728HopperStand\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86870\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u662f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76843\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5206\u79bb\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e2\u7a33\u5b9a\u53c8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D-SLIM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u56e0\u679c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\uff1a\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u51733D\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61-\u6307\u4ee4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa3D-SLIM\uff083D\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u63a9\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u66ff\u4ee3\u56e0\u679c\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u6807\u8bb0\u987a\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\uff08\u4f7f\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u8bb0\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3002", "result": "3D-SLIM\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u3001\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u79cd3D\u573a\u666f-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "3D-SLIM\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSeeNav-Agent\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u51cf\u5c11\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SRGPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347VLN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6b65\u7ea7\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5SRGPO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5206\u7ec4\u6b65\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b", "result": "GPT-4.1\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u6837\u672cVP\u6a21\u5757\u540e\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u738786.7%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73LVLM\u7ea620\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bQwen2.5-VL-3B\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7SRGPO\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fbe\u523072.3%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u4f73\u73b0\u6709LVLM\u6a21\u578b5.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1bSRGPO\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u548cGiGPO", "conclusion": "SeeNav-Agent\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u548cSRGPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLN\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd"}}

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.", "AI": {"tldr": "F2D2\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6269\u6563\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u4e2a\u4f3c\u7136\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6210\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u5230\u4ec5\u51e0\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u4f3c\u7136\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6d41\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\uff08F2D2\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8026\u5408ODE\u5171\u4eab\u5e95\u5c42\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6563\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u5c11\u6b65\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6dfb\u52a0\u6563\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u3002", "result": "F2D2\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5c11\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f2\u6b65MeanFlow\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u7684\u53cd\u5411NFE\u5c31\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a1024\u6b65\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "F2D2\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points.

Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "AW-LSSVM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743LS-SVM\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f7f\u7528\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u800c\u4e0d\u5f3a\u5236\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743LS-SVM\uff08AW-LSSVM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u56fe\u5728\u524d\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\uff0c\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAW-LSSVM\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AW-LSSVM\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u8026\u5408\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u9694\u79bb\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5371\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982GDPR\u7684\"\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\"\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5e94\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5371\u673a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4fdd\u7559\u6982\u5ff5\u5d29\u6e83\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\u8fde\u9501\u635f\u5bb3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9057\u5fd8\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5e08\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u7406\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u6b65\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6ca1\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f7f\u884c\u4e1a\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9075\u5b88\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002"}}

This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains.

Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy.

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence.

To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\\% and 91.07\\%.

However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios.

We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e72\u6270\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u7834\u574f\u9ad8\u65af\u6e90\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u978d\u70b9\u7531\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6784\u6210\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u6270\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u805a\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e72\u6270\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u8bd5\u56fe\u7834\u574f\u9ad8\u65af\u6e90\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u5931\u771f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cWasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e72\u6270\u4e3a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5206\u5e03\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5c42\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c42\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b08-10\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136DUSt3R\u3001VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u90e8\u5206\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ea4\u66ff\u5168\u5c40-\u5e27\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u5de5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1) \u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5e27\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8865\u4e01\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884cK/V\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u5747\u503c\u586b\u5145\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\u6765\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728VGGT\u548c\u03c0\u00b3\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b08-10\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices.

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models.

While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0REVIN\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f73\u57df\u5185\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u548c\u901a\u9053\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u6cdb\u5316\u7684TSFMs\u4e2d\u5374\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8REVIN\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "REVIN\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672cMASE\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8689%\uff1b\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8644%\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5339\u914d\u6700\u4f73\u57df\u5185\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff080.84 MASE\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "REVIN\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u5229\u7528\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u5c3a\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002"}}

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Panel2Patch\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u591a\u9762\u677f\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ece\u56fe\u5f62\u5230\u9762\u677f\u518d\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7ea7\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e22\u5f03\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b9e\u9645\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "Panel2Patch\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u89e3\u6790\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u6807\u9898\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u5f62\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u914d\u5bf9\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4ece\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6559\u5b66\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u805a\u7126\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6587\u732e\u56fe\u5f62\uff0cPanel2Pipeline\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Panel2Patch\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u624b\u52bf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u4e0d\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u540c\u6b65", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u9002\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b2) \u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u5c42\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e30\u5bcc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u8def\u5f84\uff1b4) \u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u8282\u70b9\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u7f1d\u62fc\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8d28\u91cf"}}

Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients.

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models.

While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods.

However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities.

However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "UAUTrack\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u53cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6d41\u3001\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7814\u7a76\u867d\u7136\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86RGB\u3001TIR\u548cRGB-T\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u53cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u8d77\u6b65\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUAUTrack\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6d41\u3001\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u805a\u7126\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728Anti-UAV\u548cDUT Anti-UAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728Anti-UAV410\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "UAUTrack\u4e3a\u53cd\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones.

Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).\n  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.\n  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness.

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAttMetNet\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eSentinel-2\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408NDMI\u6307\u6570\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236U-Net\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7532\u70f7\u662f\u5f3a\u6548\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u6bd4\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u8bef\u62a5\u4e14\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u7532\u70f7\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAttMetNet\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u878d\u5408\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7532\u70f7\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6570(NDMI)\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7532\u70f7\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4) \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAttMetNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff1b2) \u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e73\u8861\uff1b3) \u66f4\u9ad8\u7684IoU\uff08\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd4\uff09\uff1b4) \u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AttMetNet\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408NDMI\u7684\u7fbd\u6d41\u654f\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions.

Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \\textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \\textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks.

However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "PhyCustom\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u6765\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u5b9a\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5177\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u5173\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhyCustom\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff1a1\uff09\u7b49\u8ddd\u635f\u5931\uff08isometric loss\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b2\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u635f\u5931\uff08decouple loss\uff09\u5e2e\u52a9\u6d88\u9664\u72ec\u7acb\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPhyCustom\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCustom\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u610f\u5916\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u5de8\u5927\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8636\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ecCNN\u548cViT\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u811a\u672c\u90fd\u5df2\u53d1\u5e03\u4ee5\u4f9b\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e94\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u503e\u5411\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

A Cross-Generator Study", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u578bAI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08IP-AIGC\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u5357\u4e9a\u9762\u5b54\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u57df\u5185\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\uff08IP-AIGC\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u540c\u4e00\u4eba\u7269\u4ee5\u65b0\u670d\u88c5\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6216\u5149\u7167\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5370\u5ea6\u548c\u5357\u4e9a\u9762\u5b54\u3002", "method": "1. \u4eceFairFD\u548cHAV-DF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5370\u5ea6\u9762\u5b54\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u4e1aWeb-UI\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08Gemini\u548cChatGPT\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efd\u7684IP-AIGC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08HIDF-img-ip-genai\u548cHIDF-vid-ip-genai\uff09\uff1b3. \u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08AIDE\u548cEffort\uff09\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528AUC\u3001AP\u3001EER\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u57df\u5185\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u5982Effort AUC\u4ece0.739\u63d0\u5347\u52300.944\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efdIP-AIGC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u5982AIDE AUC\u4ece0.923\u4e0b\u964d\u52300.563\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u5728\u975eIP\u7684HIDF\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u822c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "IP-AIGC-\u5370\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u5370\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u7f29\u5c0fAIGC\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks.

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality.

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits.

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "InEx\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u505a\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInEx\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInEx\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864%-27%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "InEx\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684MLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "U4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u76844D LiDAR\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u96be\u5230\u6613\"\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u5300\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5747\u5300\u751f\u6210\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u4ea7\u751f\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bed\u4e49\u6311\u6218\u533a\u57df\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\"\u96be\u5230\u6613\"\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u71b5\u533a\u57df\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u8865\u5168\uff08\u5408\u6210\u5269\u4f59\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u6df7\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a(MoST)\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cU4D\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684LiDAR\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "U4D\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864D LiDAR\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
