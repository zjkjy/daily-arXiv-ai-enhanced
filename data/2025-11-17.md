### [1] [Accelerating Controllable Generation via Hybrid-grained Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11031)
*Lin Liu,Huixia Ben,Shuo Wang,Jinda Lu,Junxiang Qiu,Shengeng Tang,Yanbin Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存方法（HGC），通过在不同计算阶段采用不同粒度的缓存策略来减少可控生成模型的计算开销，显著提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在处理控制条件和内容生成时计算需求高、生成效率低的问题。

Method: 采用粗粒度缓存（块级）基于特征重用来动态绕过模型推理各步骤间编码器-解码器块的冗余计算；设计细粒度缓存（提示级）在模块内重用连续推理步骤间的交叉注意力映射，并将其扩展到相邻步骤的相应模块计算。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证了HGC的有效性，特别是在COCO-Stuff分割基准上，计算成本（MACs）显著降低63%（从18.22T到6.70T），同时语义保真度损失控制在1.5%以内。

Conclusion: HGC方法能够有效平衡生成效率和视觉质量，为可控生成模型提供了高效的计算优化方案。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

### [2] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI系统在有限时间内无限制能力增长的条件，提出了基于可观测数据的可测试证书来区分失控增长与正常行为，并提供了实际可实施的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统在什么可测量条件下会出现能力无限制增长（失控增长），以及在什么条件下可以排除这种可能性，用可测试的条件和可部署的控制来替代猜测。

Method: 开发了一个递归自我改进的分析框架，将能力增长与资源建设和部署策略联系起来，利用物理和信息理论限制定义服务包络，建立内生增长模型耦合资本与计算、数据和能源。

Result: 推导出将可观测序列映射为失控与正常行为证书的决策规则，提供了基于功率上限、吞吐量限制和评估门控等实际可实施的安全控制措施。

Conclusion: 该框架用可测试的条件和可部署的控制来认证或排除AI奇点，将猜测替换为实证基础的分析方法。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现数据归属方法在真实世界模型（如Stable Diffusion）上的大规模应用迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为微创结直肠手术提供了首个基于共识的验证视频评估工具，可标准化培训、加速能力获取并推动数据驱动的质量改进。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Result: 该方法在保持模型精度方面优于现有方法，实现了更高的剪枝率。

Conclusion: 所提出的剪枝方法在数据有限的情况下能够有效平衡剪枝率和模型精度，具有更好的实用性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Motivation: 解决基于子模子集选择的归因方法在效率上的限制，这些方法虽然忠实度高但计算成本大，阻碍了在实际场景中的部署应用。

Method: 采用分阶段粗到细搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，替代传统的二次成本贪婪选择，以近似贪婪行为。

Result: PhaseWin仅使用20%的计算预算就达到了贪婪归因95%以上的忠实度，在目标检测和视觉定位任务中始终优于其他归因基线方法。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为目标级多模态模型建立了可扩展、高忠实度归因的新技术标准，在计算效率和归因质量之间实现了良好平衡。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种正负提示监督方法，通过优化正负提示来增强基于能量的OOD检测性能，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在OOD检测中使用负提示时，往往包含过于广泛的非ID特征，导致捕获重叠或误导性信息，影响检测效果。

Method: 使用LLM初始化类特定的正负提示，然后优化这些提示：正提示关注类内特征，负提示突出类别边界特征。采用基于图的架构聚合语义监督并传播到视觉分支。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化提示表示和语义知识传递实现了更好的检测效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非约束性真实环境中，面部表情识别仍具挑战性，需要平衡性能与效率的轻量级模型。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF两个基准分类数据集转换为目标检测格式，使用mAP 0.5、精确度、召回率和混淆矩阵评估YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n模型性能。

Result: YOLOv12n在干净KDEF数据集上获得最高mAP 0.5为95.6，在FER2013数据集上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精确度达65.2，假阳性更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能有效平衡敏感性与精确度，适用于实时、资源受限的情感感知AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为异构互补蒸馏（HCD）的框架，用于解决异构架构（如ViT到ResNet18）知识蒸馏中的特征表示差异问题。该方法通过整合教师和学生的互补特征，在共享logits中对齐表示，并通过子logit解耦蒸馏和正交性损失来促进多样化的知识转移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构架构知识蒸馏面临空间特征表示差异的挑战，传统方法主要针对同构架构设计，而现有的异构方法计算成本高、设计复杂或过度依赖logit对齐，无法充分利用互补特征。

Method: 提出HCD框架：1）通过卷积投影器和自适应池化处理学生中间特征；2）与教师倒数第二层特征拼接，通过互补特征映射器（CFM）生成共享logits；3）引入子logit解耦蒸馏（SDD）将共享logits划分为n个子logits；4）使用正交性损失（OL）确保子logit多样性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、细粒度数据集（如CUB200）和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，HCD优于最先进的知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Conclusion: FedBCS通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，提升了医学图像分割的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过注入有效的物理先验并利用大语言模型的跨模态推理能力，能够精确捕捉细微情感线索，实现了运动语义对齐和可解释的微表情识别。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

TL;DR: ERMoE是一种稀疏MoE架构，通过将专家重新参数化为学习正交特征基，并使用特征基得分（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由，稳定专家利用并促进可解释的专业化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE架构中的两个核心挑战：路由器逻辑与专家内部结构不对齐导致的路由不稳定和专家利用不足，以及负载不平衡造成的瓶颈问题。标准解决方案（如辅助负载均衡损失）会削弱专家专业化并损害下游性能。

Method: 将每个专家重新参数化为学习的正交特征基，用特征基得分（输入特征与专家基的余弦相似度）替代学习门控逻辑，实现内容感知路由，无需显式平衡损失。

Result: 在ImageNet分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准（如COCO、Flickr30K）上达到最先进精度，自然产生更平坦的专家负载分布。3D MRI变体（ERMoE-ba）将脑年龄预测准确率提高7%以上，并产生解剖学上可解释的专家专业化。

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入新的架构原则，直接解决路由不稳定问题，在保持稀疏性的同时实现可扩展、可解释的专业化和改进性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP基础类增量学习的简单有效框架，通过解耦视觉编码器适配和文本软提示优化来解决分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT进一步引入最优传输校准策略来对齐内存统计信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP基础类增量学习方法存在分类器偏差问题，当学习新类别时文本原型会过度拟合最新类别，导致遗忘先前知识。同时，生成式重放方法忽略了视觉编码器更新带来的分布漂移问题。

Method: 提出两阶段框架DMC：第一阶段冻结文本提示优化视觉编码器，第二阶段冻结视觉编码器优化文本软提示。DMC-OT版本引入最优传输引导的校准策略对齐内存统计信息，并采用任务特定提示设计增强任务间可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上的广泛实验表明，DMC和DMC-OT都达到了最先进的性能，其中DMC-OT平均准确率进一步提高了1.80%。

Conclusion: DMC框架通过解耦视觉和文本模态的优化，有效缓解了类增量学习中的分类器偏差问题。DMC-OT通过最优传输校准进一步提升了性能，为CLIP基础类增量学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

### [16] [PAS: A Training-Free Stabilizer for Temporal Encoding in Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10979)
*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)方法，通过应用相反相位偏移并聚合输出来解决视频LLMs中的时间不一致性问题，无需训练即可提升时间编码的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题：帧时序的微小变化会导致注意力翻转并抑制相关帧。这种不稳定性源于通过多模态RoPE将Rotary Position Embeddings扩展到视频时产生的时间核波纹效应。

Method: 提出PAS方法：在多个注意力头中应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。该方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并降低相位敏感性，而不改变位置编码结构。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，在匹配token预算下显示出一致的改进，计算开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLMs提供了即插即用的鲁棒时间编码升级方案，通过平滑时间核实现对小时间偏移的Lipschitz稳定注意力。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，用于零样本视觉任务，通过量化和二值化将开放性问题转化为多项选择题和真/假验证问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中面临开放性问题回答的挑战，需要一种无需额外训练的统一工作流来提升性能。

Method: 工作流包含两个步骤：(1) 量化：将开放性问题转化为多项选择题；(2) 二值化：将每个候选答案转化为真/假问题，通过确定性规则进行选择。

Result: 在引用表达定位、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw等任务上，量化到多项选择题带来大幅提升，真/假二值化提供额外增益，所有任务均获得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作流为现有视觉语言模型提供了一个简单实用的零样本视觉增强路径，强调推理时设计而非任务特定训练，具有通用性和有效性。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLUE是一个基于Stable Diffusion的生成模型框架，通过固定格式提示实现多样且稳定的图像生成，无需额外数据。在医学领域有限数据集上显著提升了生成质量和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像合成模型在专业领域（如医学）中面临的数据类型有限、数量不足的问题，实现多样生成同时保持稳定性。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入Style Encoder处理图像和提示生成风格嵌入，通过新的第二注意力层和KL散度实现潜在空间的连续高斯表示。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上，FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练分类器在1000%规模下F1分数达83.21%，合成与真实数据结合达94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，是领域特定应用的有效数据增强方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过提示注意分层对比学习来解决模态缺失问题，显著提升了在模态不完整情况下的跨模态表示鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在真实场景中当某些模态缺失时性能显著下降，主要源于完整多模态数据与不完整模态场景之间的表示学习不一致。现有方法通过相对简单的生成方法处理缺失模态，但无法充分保持跨模态一致性。

Method: PROMISE创新地将多模态提示学习融入分层对比学习框架，配备专门设计的提示注意机制，动态为缺失特定模态的场景生成鲁棒且一致的表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验和全面消融研究清楚表明，PROMISE相比当前最先进的多模态方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PROMISE通过提示注意分层对比学习有效弥合了完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距，为模态缺失场景提供了鲁棒的跨模态表示解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid是首个专为创意媒体设计的多模态情感标注视频数据集，包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画贴纸，每段视频都有情感标签、视觉属性和文本描述。基于此开发了情感条件视频生成技术，显著提升了文本到视频和图像到视频生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统主要关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，视频领域缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，特别是在风格化和非现实情境下。

Method: 引入EmoVid数据集，通过系统分析揭示视觉特征与情感感知的空间和时间模式，并基于这些洞察开发了通过微调Wan2.1模型的情感条件视频生成技术。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，定量指标和生成视频的视觉质量都有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算设立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格视频中的视觉情感分析提供了宝贵见解，还为增强视频生成中的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中存在视觉处理瓶颈，容易丢失视觉证据的接地性，缺乏情境化的视觉体验。受人类认知记忆理论启发，需要为VLMs配备动态潜在视觉记忆。

Method: 提出VisMem框架，包含短期模块用于细粒度感知保留和长期模块用于抽象语义整合，这些记忆在推理过程中无缝调用，保持感知保真度和语义一致性。

Result: 在多样化的视觉理解、推理和生成基准测试中，VisMem相比原始模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法。

Conclusion: VisMem为潜在空间记忆增强建立了新范式，通过认知对齐的视觉记忆机制显著提升了视觉语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

*Sumin Yu,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard是一种针对扩散式文本到图像模型的安全防护方法，通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，只在图像的不安全区域进行引导，在提高安全性的同时最小化对内容的意外修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性（无法根据提示词调整引导强度）和选择性（无法只针对图像的不安全区域），而扩散式T2I模型在生成高质量图像的同时也容易创建有害内容，这引发了社会担忧并凸显了对更安全生成的需求。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词危害性并应用选择性引导掩码，只对图像的不安全区域进行引导，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard比现有方法生成更安全的图像，同时最小化了对内容的意外修改。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究结果还强调了图像生成中透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳跃连接编码器-解码器架构（U-Net变体）在逆问题中仍存在信息丢失问题，限制了高频细节的恢复。

Method: 利用小波的完美重构特性防止信息退化，同时选择性抑制冗余特征，作为即插即用解码器块集成到各种U-Net变体中。

Result: 在裂缝检测基准测试中显著提升了细裂缝（宽度小于4像素）的分割性能；在智能手机图像去噪中PSNR也有适度提升，证明了其在低频和高频场景下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块具有即插即用的通用性，在统一的、重构感知框架内实现了高频保真度和全局一致性。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Method: 使用模拟器和真实世界数据构建基准，通过模型、规则和人工方法在严格质量控制下生成大规模问题，涵盖场景理解、对象理解、感知评估和协作决策四个维度。

Result: 对40个MLLMs的评估显示在协作感知任务中存在显著性能差距，最佳模型平均落后人类24.38%，且在不同任务间表现不一致。微调实验证实了空中协作感知和推理中模拟到真实迁移的可行性。

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估的空白，揭示了MLLMs在复杂协作场景中的局限性，并为改进模型性能提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型未能利用胚胎发育的分布先验来提高准确性，且依赖单焦点信息导致胚胎表示不完整，在细胞遮挡下容易产生特征模糊。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散框架：1) 训练冻结帧级编码器提取多焦点特征；2) 多焦点特征融合构建3D感知形态表示，设计混合语义边界条件块注入扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上取得最先进结果，仅需单次去噪步骤即可达到82.8%和81.3%的平均测试准确率。

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff通过扩散模型和多焦点特征融合有效解决了胚胎发育阶段识别中的特征模糊问题，显著提升了分类准确性。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: CrossMed是一个评估医学多模态大语言模型组合泛化能力的基准，使用模态-解剖-任务（MAT）框架，将四个公共数据集统一为视觉问答格式，包含20,200个多项选择题实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态LLMs在未见过的成像模态、解剖部位和任务类型组合上的泛化能力尚未充分探索，需要专门基准来评估组合泛化能力。

Method: 使用MAT框架将CheXpert、SIIM-ACR、BraTS 2020和MosMedData四个数据集统一为VQA格式，评估LLaVA-Vicuna-7B和Qwen2-VL-7B在相关、不相关和零重叠MAT分割上的表现。

Result: 在相关分割上模型达到83.2%分类准确率和0.75分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务迁移显示仅使用分类数据训练也能提升分割性能7% cIoU。

Conclusion: CrossMed为医学视觉语言模型提供了评估零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化能力的严格测试平台，多模态LLMs在组合泛化方面表现独特优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H²ARN)来解决文本-3D检索中的层次表示崩溃和冗余诱导显著性稀释问题，通过在双曲空间中嵌入文本和3D数据来保持层次距离，并发布了扩展的T3DR-HIT v2基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本-3D检索方法面临两个主要挑战：层次表示崩溃（HRC）将抽象到具体和整体到部分的层次压缩在欧几里得嵌入中，以及冗余诱导显著性稀释（RISD）平均噪声片段，模糊关键语义线索并降低模型区分困难负样本的能力。

Method: H²ARN将文本和3D数据嵌入到Lorentz模型双曲空间中，利用指数体积增长保持层次距离。采用层次排序损失构建围绕每个文本向量的收缩蕴含锥，确保匹配的3D实例落在锥内，同时实例级对比损失强制与不匹配样本分离。针对RISD，提出贡献感知双曲聚合模块，利用Lorentz距离评估每个局部特征的相关性，并应用双曲几何指导的贡献加权聚合。

Result: 发布了扩展的T3DR-HIT v2基准数据集，包含8,935个文本-3D对，是原始大小的2.6倍，涵盖细粒度文化文物和复杂室内场景。代码已开源。

Conclusion: H²ARN通过双曲空间嵌入有效解决了文本-3D检索中的层次表示崩溃和冗余诱导显著性稀释问题，提升了检索性能。

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

Motivation: 现有的生成式图像合成方法在同时保持细节和调整前景姿态/视角方面仍存在困难，需要解决前景与背景的兼容性问题。

Method: 扩展现有生成式合成模型为多参考版本，允许使用任意数量的前景参考图像，并提出校准前景参考图像的全局和局部特征，使其与背景信息兼容。

Conclusion: 通过多参考图像和特征校准，生成式图像合成模型能够更好地处理细节保持和前景姿态调整的问题。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

TL;DR: LiteAttention利用扩散注意力在去噪步骤间的时间相干性，通过早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策，在保持质量的同时显著加速视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散变换器在视频生成中存在二次注意力复杂度问题，导致延迟过高。动态稀疏注意力方法计算开销大且存在估计误差，而静态稀疏模式在去噪过程中往往不是最优的。

Method: 利用扩散注意力稀疏模式在去噪步骤间的时间相干性，提出LiteAttention方法，通过早期标记非必要tile并向前传播跳过决策，避免重复计算开销。

Result: 在FlashAttention基础上实现高度优化的LiteAttention内核，在生成视频扩散模型上实现显著加速，且没有质量下降。

Conclusion: LiteAttention结合了动态方法的适应性和静态方法的效率，有效解决了扩散变换器的注意力复杂度问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Motivation: 现有的放射学报告生成方法主要依赖监督微调进行图像-文本对的实例级对齐，但无法建立解剖学基础的对齐，导致生成质量不理想。

Method: 提出S2D-Align方法，采用浅到深策略：从粗粒度放射图像-报告配对开始，引入参考报告进行实例级指导，最终使用关键短语在特定解剖细节上锚定生成。通过基于记忆的适配器实现特征共享。

Conclusion: S2D-Align为增强复杂多模态生成任务中的基础能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文比较了去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器在3D形状生成和补全任务中的表现，发现扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在离散潜在空间中也能达到或超越扩散模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成模型在包括3D数据在内的多种数据模态中得到了广泛应用，但对于哪种模型最适合特定任务尚未达成共识。此外，文本和图像等条件信息经常被用于引导生成过程，而部分3D数据等条件信息尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 本研究比较了两种最有前景的生成模型——去噪扩散概率模型和自回归因果变换器，并将它们适配用于生成形状建模和补全任务。进行了彻底的定量评估和比较，包括基线判别模型和广泛的消融研究。

Result: 结果显示：(1) 具有连续潜在空间的扩散模型在从单个噪声深度图像进行多模态形状补全的任务中，优于判别模型和自回归方法，并在现实条件下实现了最先进的性能；(2) 在相同的离散潜在空间中比较时，自回归模型可以在这些任务上匹配或超越扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中表现最佳，而自回归模型在离散潜在空间中也能达到竞争性性能，为不同应用场景下的模型选择提供了指导。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Motivation: 现有KBVQA方法要么通过上下文学习利用MLLMs的隐式知识，要么通过检索增强生成利用显式知识，但都缺乏MLLMs的显式多步推理轨迹。

Method: 1) 使用冻结的7B规模MLLM构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；2) 自蒸馏为CoT生成器和知识生成器；3) 通过KEPO优化知识生成器，偏好有用但置信度低的知识；4) 利用生成的CoT和采样知识进行答案预测。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内部知识推理能力，在无需外部知识或商业API的情况下实现了KBVQA任务的优越性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Motivation: DDIB方法虽然保持了循环一致性且灵活性好，但面临翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配导致的翻译轨迹偏差问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出OT-ALD框架，计算从源域到目标域潜在分布的最优传输映射，将映射后的分布作为目标域反向扩散过程的起点，消除潜在分布不匹配。

Result: 在三个高分辨率数据集的四个翻译任务上，OT-ALD相比最佳基线模型平均采样效率提升20.29%，FID分数降低2.6。

Conclusion: OT-ALD有效平衡了快速图像翻译与图像质量，通过最优传输理论解决了DDIB的关键问题，在效率和性能上均有显著提升。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于混响变换的轨迹预测模型Rev，通过显式学习和预测智能体对轨迹变化事件的延迟响应，模拟不同智能体的延迟偏好和随机性，实现可控的轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前轨迹预测方法难以显式学习和预测智能体对轨迹变化事件的延迟响应（latencies），不同智能体对特定事件的注意、处理和反应延迟偏好各异，忽略这些延迟会削弱预测系统的因果连续性并导致不合理的轨迹。

Method: 受声学中混响曲线启发，提出混响变换和相应的Reverberation（Rev）轨迹预测模型，使用两个显式可学习的混响核来模拟和预测每个智能体的不同延迟偏好及其随机性，实现基于预测延迟的可控轨迹预测。

Result: 在多个数据集（包括行人和车辆）上的实验表明，Rev在实现竞争性预测精度的同时，能够揭示跨智能体和场景的可解释延迟动态。定性分析进一步验证了所提混响变换的特性。

Conclusion: 混响变换作为一种通用的延迟建模方法具有潜力，能够显式建模智能体对轨迹变化事件的延迟响应，提高轨迹预测的因果连续性和合理性。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法通常只能识别异常但无法区分异常类型，且需要为每个对象类别训练和维护单独的模型。此外，现有的大规模视觉语言模型计算密集且内存需求大，限制了在实时或嵌入式系统中的使用。

Method: 提出MultiTypeFCDD框架，仅使用图像级标签学习并生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定的异常类型。该模型作为单一统一框架，能够跨多个对象类别区分异常类型。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上的评估表明，该方法在显著减少参数负载和推理时间的同时，能够提供与最先进复杂模型相竞争的结果。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD是一个高度实用且可行的解决方案，特别适用于计算资源受限的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视角视频常因相机触发延迟或独立录制设置导致时序不同步，而现有4DGS方法假设输入视频流时序同步，这限制了其在真实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用粗到精对齐模块，先确定帧级粗偏移，再细化到亚帧精度，可作为即插即用模块集成到现有4DGS框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效处理时序错位视频，显著提升基线方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了4DGS框架处理异步数据的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可行的时序对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过创新的状态空间架构和视觉定位增强机制，在保持高效推理的同时实现了细粒度的视觉语言理解，为资源受限场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小规模输入变化下的可靠性仍未得到充分理解，需要系统评估模型对良性扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用大规模系统性研究方法，测试多种视觉和文本扰动类型，包括像素级位移、几何变换、缩放填充、改写和多语言重写，在多个模型和数据集上进行评估。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，大量样本在至少一种扰动下改变预测答案；样本稳定性与正确性高度相关；小模型稳定性模式可预测大模型正确性。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，重点关注模型应可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 基础模型配备模块化组件后，不再受限于初始训练范围，可以演变为医学成像的多任务、多模态系统。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Conclusion: GSD框架成功利用预训练视频扩散模型的多视角一致性先验，有效解决了3D高斯溅射在稀疏视图下的过拟合问题，并通过深度和语义指导确保了正确的相机姿态和几何精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 多模态模型中的位置偏见源于位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及使用图像-文本对进行多模态训练的性质等多种因素的组合作用。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoReMi是一个混合专家框架，通过联合建模领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支，解决多源点云领域异构性问题，在多个3D理解基准测试中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D深度学习在多领域泛化能力有限，主要由于数据集规模小且多源点云存在密度和噪声分布的显著差异，导致多领域融合时出现负迁移。现有方法要么只关注领域感知特征，要么只关注领域通用特征，忽略了二者的协同潜力。

Method: 提出DoReMi框架，包含领域感知专家分支和统一表示分支。通过领域引导空间路由动态激活专家分支，使用熵控制动态分配实现稳定高效的专家利用，同时通过多属性自监督学习预训练的统一表示分支保持跨领域几何和结构先验。

Result: 在多个3D理解基准测试中表现优异，ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，相比现有方法具有竞争力或更优性能。

Conclusion: DoReMi展示了作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力，能够有效解决多源点云领域异构性问题，实现专业知识和泛化知识的协同学习。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决少样本风格编辑问题，通过混合专家路由机制和自动秩选择策略，实现了参数高效的多风格适应。

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

TL;DR: GEODE模型通过解耦3D推理和数值生成，解决了现有视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈问题，使用专门的模块实现空间推理和精确回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间智能理解上存在根本性困难，主要源于输入阶段的几何感知编码器计算成本高与2D特征浅层化的冲突，以及输出阶段离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值的错位问题。

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含两个即插即用模块：解耦推理模块（DRM）作为空间协处理器，通过交叉注意力对齐3D数据与2D视觉特征，并将空间思维链逻辑提炼为可注入的推理令牌；直接回归头（DRH）采用"嵌入即值"范式，将专用控制令牌路由到轻量级MLP进行标量和3D边界框的精确连续回归。

Result: 仅1.5B参数的模型实现了最先进的空间推理性能，可与7B+模型相媲美，作为高级语义调度器发挥作用。

Conclusion: GEODE通过模块化设计成功解决了视觉语言模型在3D空间理解上的双重瓶颈，证明了小参数模型也能实现高质量的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

### [58] [Discovering Meaningful Units with Visually Grounded Semantics from Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11262)
*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过分组caption tokens来获取细粒度语言表示的视觉语言模型，旨在更好地理解真实世界中的对象级信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要关注图像块与语言token的对齐，但图像块对人类无意义，单个token也不一定携带可接地的图像信息。需要将token分组来描述场景的不同方面，以获得细粒度的知识理解。

Method: 提出一种在架构中分组caption tokens的模型，学习将token分组以捕获细粒度的语言表示，并将这些表示与经过训练发现对象的图像编码器输出进行对齐。

Result: 通过学习token分组，视觉语言模型在视觉和语言理解方面具有更好的细粒度理解能力。模型发现的token组在定性和定量上都与文本中的可接地短语高度相似。

Conclusion: 通过分组caption tokens的方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，所发现的token组与真实世界中的可接地信息高度对应。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountSteer是一种无需训练的方法，通过引导扩散模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态来提高文本到图像生成中对象计数的准确性，在不影响视觉质量的情况下提升约4%的计数准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真连贯的图像，但往往无法正确遵循文本中的数字指令，这揭示了语言和视觉表示之间的差距。研究发现模型并非完全对数字不敏感，它们隐式地意识到自己的计数准确性。

Method: 基于模型内部已经编码了数值正确性的潜在概念这一发现，提出了CountSteer方法。该方法在推理过程中引导模型的交叉注意力隐藏状态，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，CountSteer将对象计数准确率提高了约4%，同时不损害视觉质量。

Conclusion: CountSteer展示了向更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成迈出的简单而有效的一步。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: 通过控制生成无偏、平衡的合成数据来微调视觉语言模型，能有效提升模型性能并减少偏见，在真实世界数据上表现出色。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶规划中缺乏对空间结构和动态交互关系的显式监督，限制了它们从原始传感器数据中推断交通实体间相互影响的能力。

Method: 提出模型无关的方法，将不同抽象层次和格式的交通场景图序列化，通过结构化提示模板将其整合到模型中，系统分析关系监督的效益。

Result: 在LangAuto基准测试上的广泛评估显示，场景图条件化使最先进方法的驾驶性能大幅提升，LMDrive驾驶分数提升15.6%，BEVDriver提升17.5%。

Conclusion: 即使测试时不需要场景图输入，模型也能通过场景图条件化训练更好地内化和基础关系先验知识，显著改善自动驾驶性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Motivation: 现有体积医学图像分割方法依赖硬二进制阈值定义正负样本，丢弃了连续解剖相似性信息，且忽视了全局解剖进展的方向一致性，导致特征空间扭曲。

Method: CORAL采用对比排序目标利用连续解剖相似性，确保切片间特征距离与其解剖位置差异成比例；同时引入序数目标强制全局方向一致性，使学习特征分布与跨患者的标准解剖进展对齐。

Result: CORAL在有限标注设置下的基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时学习了具有有意义解剖结构的表示。

Conclusion: 通过协调学习框架，CORAL能够学习解剖信息丰富的表示，显著提升下游分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark通过利用图像低频分量的固有稳定性，成功实现了免噪声模拟的鲁棒水印嵌入，为AIGC时代提供了更可靠的水印保护方案。

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Method: 提出AUVIC框架，应用对抗性扰动实现精确的视觉概念遗忘，有效隔离目标概念而不影响相似实体。

Result: 实验结果表明AUVIC实现了最先进的目标遗忘率，同时对非目标概念的性能影响最小。

Conclusion: AUVIC为MLLMs中的视觉概念遗忘提供了有效解决方案，并构建了首个评估视觉概念遗忘的基准VCUBench。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Conclusion: DocSLM能够在轻量级边缘设备上提供可靠的多模态文档理解，实现了高效性和性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个综合性事件相机合成数据集，确定了最优的事件表示方法，为事件视觉研究提供了可直接使用的标准化资源和可复现的基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: 放松显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力，为3D运动生成提供了可扩展和数据高效的范式。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合隐马尔可夫随机场（HMRF）理论和CNN分割的方法，实现无监督学习和快速分割，在PU泡沫结构的μCT图像数据集上展示了高分割精度，并提出了减少标注数据需求的预训练策略。

Conclusion: HMRF-UNet方法成功结合了无监督学习和快速分割的优势，为材料科学中的图像分割提供了一种高效解决方案，同时通过预训练策略降低了数据标注需求。

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于低秩稀疏原则的统一框架LSEF，通过分层建模情感动态，将情感分解为长期情感基调和短期情感波动，显著提升了视频情感计算的鲁棒性和动态区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频情感计算面临模型不稳定和表征退化问题，核心限制是缺乏分层结构机制来解耦不同的情感成分（情感基调和瞬时波动）。

Method: 提出LSEF框架，包含三个即插即用模块：稳定性编码模块捕获低秩情感基调，动态解耦模块分离稀疏瞬时信号，一致性集成模块重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，采用秩感知优化策略自适应平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态区分能力。

Conclusion: 分层低秩稀疏建模对于理解情感动态具有有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

TL;DR: Q-Doc是一个三层次评估框架，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在文档图像质量评估中的能力，发现MLLMs具有初步DIQA能力但存在评分不一致、失真识别错误等关键限制，而思维链提示能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的能力已超越高级视觉任务，但它们在文档图像质量评估方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估其DIQA能力。

Method: 提出三层次评估框架：粗粒度层让MLLMs为文档图像分配质量分数；中粒度层设计失真类型识别任务；细粒度层引入失真严重程度评估。使用思维链提示来增强性能。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs具有初步DIQA能力，但存在评分不一致、失真误识别和严重程度误判等关键限制。思维链提示在所有层次上都显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为MLLMs的DIQA能力提供了基准，揭示了它们在质量感知方面的明显缺陷，并指出了有前景的改进途径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA是一个用于类增量学习的新框架，通过仅调整CLIP的跨模态桥接层，无需额外参数即可实现稳定知识积累，并利用正交低秩融合防止遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP在类增量学习中面临的两个挑战：适应下游任务需要额外模块增加复杂性，以及多模态表示潜力未充分挖掘。

Method: 在CLIP的跨模态桥接层进行正交低秩融合，约束参数更新到与过去任务特征正交的低秩安全子空间，并使用跨模态混合原型。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BOFA相比现有方法实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA框架通过桥接层正交融合有效解决了CLIP在类增量学习中的适应性和遗忘问题，无需数据回放即可实现稳定知识积累。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出自适应教学范式来解决视觉-脑电信号不对称对齐问题，通过让视觉模态动态调整其知识结构来匹配脑电模态的能力，在零样本脑到图像检索任务上达到60.2%的top-1准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉和脑电模态之间的根本不对称性，包括保真度差距（EEG噪声与视觉高保真特征）和语义差距（EEG浅层概念表示与视觉丰富语义深度），导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出自适应教学范式，让教师模态（视觉）在任务指导下动态收缩和调整知识结构，使用ShrinkAdapter模块（残差自由设计和瓶颈结构）来实现。

Result: 在零样本脑到图像检索任务上达到60.2%的top-1准确率，比之前最先进方法提高了9.8%。

Conclusion: 教师必须收缩和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距，为不对称对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

TL;DR: WEAVE是首个用于上下文交织跨模态理解和生成的套件，包含WEAVE-100k大规模数据集和WEAVEBench人工标注基准，旨在解决现有方法在真实世界多轮图像创建和编辑中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集和基准主要关注单轮交互，无法捕捉真实世界图像创建和编辑的多轮、上下文依赖特性，因此需要开发支持多轮交互的跨模态理解和生成能力。

Method: 构建WEAVE-100k数据集（10万交织样本，37万对话轮次，50万图像）和WEAVEBench基准（100个任务，480张图像），采用基于参考图像和原始图像与编辑指令组合的混合VLM评判器评估框架。

Result: 在WEAVE-100k上训练能够提升视觉理解、图像编辑以及理解-生成协作能力，促进UMMs发展出新兴的视觉记忆能力，但WEAVEBench评估揭示了当前方法在多轮上下文感知图像生成和编辑方面的持续局限性。

Conclusion: WEAVE为多模态社区研究上下文交织理解和生成提供了视角和基础，推动了多轮交互场景下的跨模态能力发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架，用于区分文本到图像扩散模型中的识别与实现能力，重点关注文化参考的多模态图标性现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆之间的模糊界限，特别关注文化共享关联的多模态图标性现象。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别（模型是否识别参考）与实现（如何通过复制或重新诠释描绘），评估5个扩散模型在767个维基数据文化参考上的表现，并进行提示扰动实验。

Result: 框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换；模型即使文本提示改变也常重现图标视觉结构；文化对齐与训练数据频率、文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制内容，更在于如何转换和重新情境化文化知识，推动评估超越简单的文本-图像匹配，实现更丰富的语境理解。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM是一个受大脑启发的条件扩散框架，通过显式建模皮层组织来解码fMRI信号，将视觉区域分为早期/中期/晚期流，构建与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，实现高效可解释的图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的解码器直接基于fMRI特征而不分析视觉信息在皮层中的组织方式，忽略了大脑的层次处理结构，模糊了不同视觉区域的作用。

Method: 使用ROI适配器将fMRI分组为早期/中期/晚期流，转换为多尺度皮层金字塔，通过轻量级深度匹配的ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定提示。

Result: 在自然场景数据集上的实验显示，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 基于皮层层次结构构建条件机制是纯数据驱动嵌入的强大替代方案，为研究视觉皮层提供了有用视角。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏对多模态大语言模型理解视觉提示能力的系统评估，而视觉提示是人类直观的交互方式，需要明确当前模型是否能有效识别和使用视觉提示。

Method: 采用两阶段评估框架：第一阶段评估模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，使用30k个可视化提示；第二阶段评估视觉提示对下游任务的影响。

Result: 评估了28个MLLM模型，包括专有系统和开源模型，提供了影响视觉提示理解的全面分析，如视觉提示属性变化、问题安排和模型规模等因素。

Conclusion: VP-Bench为研究多模态大语言模型如何理解和解决基于视觉提示的问题建立了新的参考框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

Motivation: 解决遥感多模态分类中因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气效应导致的模态缺失问题，现有方法计算成本高且假设训练时数据完整，限制了在真实世界不完整场景下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出缺失感知的LoRA混合框架，将模态缺失重新定义为多任务学习问题，引入任务导向的动态路由器和模态特定共享的静态路由器双路由机制，通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家重用实现参数高效自适应。

Conclusion: MaMOL是一个通用且高效的解决方案，适用于不完整多模态学习，具有优越的鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

Conclusion: 基于H&E的不确定性感知PD-L1预测是向临床工作流程中可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出的有前景的一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: PAS是一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，有效利用先前被忽视的注意力信号来检测和缓解大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

### [81] [Bridging Hidden States in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11526)
*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块，通过在视觉和文本编码器顶部添加少量双向注意力层来对齐两种模态的隐藏状态，无需绑定自回归解码器，在保持双编码器效率的同时提升了多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型融合方法要么在编码器早期混合token/特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，且常与自回归解码器绑定。然而两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含丰富的模态特定结构信息，直接对齐这些状态是更自然的方式。

Method: 在视觉和文本编码器顶部附近放置少量仅跨模态的双向注意力层，将隐藏状态序列投影到共享空间，进行跨模态注意力计算，并通过门控残差更新返回，使用简单稳定器改善对齐效果。

Result: 在标准检索、VQA和视觉推理基准测试中，BRIDGE优于可比较的视觉语言模型，同时保持了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE提供了一种有效的跨模态融合方法，编码器保持非因果性和强理解能力，生成任务通过可选解码器清晰解耦，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构和语义分析的无监督循环检测框架，用于检测LLM驱动的智能应用中的隐藏执行循环，在LangGraph股票市场应用中评估显示混合方法F1分数0.72，显著优于单一方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的智能应用存在非确定性行为，可能形成隐藏的执行循环，默默消耗资源而不触发显式错误，传统可观测性平台无法检测这些代价高昂的低效问题。

Method: 结合结构和语义分析的无监督循环检测框架：首先应用计算高效的时间调用栈分析识别显式循环，然后利用语义相似性分析发现以冗余内容生成为特征的微妙循环。

Result: 在基于LangGraph的股票市场应用的1575个轨迹上评估，混合方法F1分数0.72（精确率0.62，召回率0.86），显著优于单一结构方法（F1:0.08）和语义方法（F1:0.28）。

Conclusion: 虽然结果令人鼓舞，但仍有很大改进空间，未来工作需要完善方法并解决当前局限性。

Abstract: Agentic applications powered by Large Language Models exhibit non-deterministic behaviors that can form hidden execution cycles, silently consuming resources without triggering explicit errors. Traditional observability platforms fail to detect these costly inefficiencies. We present an unsupervised cycle detection framework that combines structural and semantic analysis. Our approach first applies computationally efficient temporal call stack analysis to identify explicit loops and then leverages semantic similarity analysis to uncover subtle cycles characterized by redundant content generation. Evaluated on 1575 trajectories from a LangGraph-based stock market application, our hybrid approach achieves an F1 score of 0.72 (precision: 0.62, recall: 0.86), significantly outperforming individual structural (F1: 0.08) and semantic methods (F1: 0.28). While these results are encouraging, there remains substantial scope for improvement, and future work is needed to refine the approach and address its current limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型的仿真推演数据分析方法，通过任务分解、多轮交互和自定义工具生成高质量分析报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动分析方法耗时且易出错，需要利用大语言模型的强大分析推理能力来提高效率和准确性，但单次指令无法获得结构化的高质量报告。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为子任务，为每个子任务设计系统提示和用户提示，通过多轮交互结合自检和反思进行结构化数据提取和多步分析评估，定义并调用自定义工具生成图表和计算指标。

Result: 评估结果表明，该方法生成的分析报告质量更高，得分优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效生成高质量、结构化的仿真推演分析报告，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过离线数据增强和并行检索的结构化记忆系统，用于历史人物对话系统，解决了传统方法在深度和延迟之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在体现历史人物对话时面临关键权衡：简单检索增强生成产生浅层响应，而多阶段反思虽然深度足够但延迟过高。

Method: 将传记数据转化为1774个增强的第一人称记忆，带有情感语义元数据，采用两阶段检索实现0.52秒的提示生成。

Result: 在GPT-4上与传统RAG表现相当，在较小模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-3）上显著优于传统RAG，特别适合资源受限部署。

Conclusion: 该系统不仅作为对话界面，还作为传记分析的研究工具，提供时空热图、情感轨迹分析和交互式路径跟踪等可视化功能，适用于教育、博物馆和研究应用。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于自然语言生成的混合量子-经典大语言模型HyQuT，该模型在Transformer框架中集成了变分量子电路，在8M和150M参数规模下实现了连贯且上下文感知的对话生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管量子计算已逐渐应用于替代经典计算，但现有量子或混合模型仍局限于简单任务，尚未成功应用于大规模自然语言生成。本研究旨在探索将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型中的可行性。

Method: 提出的HyQuT架构将变分量子电路(VQCs)集成到Transformer框架中，在8M和150M参数规模下进行实验。使用最少量子比特(10个量子比特和80个量子门)来替代约10%的经典参数。

Result: 实验结果表明，在150M参数模型中，仅使用10个量子比特和80个量子门就能替代约10%的经典参数，同时实现了可比较的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 这项研究为将量子计算集成到大规模生成语言模型中提供了早期可行性证明，展示了量子计算在复杂自然语言处理任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯方法来量化基于大语言模型的文本生成系统在二元评估指标中的统计不确定性，重点关注由概率性文本生成策略引起的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法往往忽视统计不确定性量化，而概率性文本生成策略会引入额外的不确定性，需要更严谨的统计方法来评估模型行为。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来量化二元评估指标中的不确定性，通过两个案例研究验证：1）评估对抗性输入上的拒绝率，2）评估开放对话中模型间的成对偏好。

Result: 贝叶斯方法能够为基于大语言模型的系统行为提供有用的不确定性量化，帮助更准确地评估模型在有害输出生成和对抗输入敏感性等方面的表现。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯不确定性量化方法能够弥补现有评估方法的不足，为基于大语言模型的文本生成系统提供更可靠的统计评估框架。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究揭示了LLM在处理时间约束时的系统性风险：双峰性能分布、极端提示脆弱性和系统性行动偏见，表明当前自回归架构无法可靠处理时间约束，需要混合架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要实时决策的智能体架构中部署LLM时，假设它们能可靠判断行动窗口是否开放，但这一假设未经测试。

Method: 使用截止时间检测任务评估8个生产级模型（2.8-8B参数），并通过200个合成示例进行微调。

Result: 发现双峰性能分布（95%或50%准确率）、极端提示脆弱性（格式变化导致30-60个百分点波动）和系统性行动偏见（失败模型100%假阳性率），参数数量与能力无相关性。

Conclusion: 时间约束满足无法通过自然语言的下一个词预测可靠学习，需要具备连续时间状态表示、显式约束检查和系统性组合推理的架构机制。

Abstract: When deploying LLMs in agentic architectures requiring real-time decisions under temporal constraints, we assume they reliably determine whether action windows remain open or have closed. This assumption is untested. We characterize temporal constraint processing across eight production-scale models (2.8-8B parameters) using deadline detection tasks, revealing systematic deployment risks: bimodal performance distribution (models achieve either 95% or 50% accuracy), extreme prompt brittleness (30-60 percentage point swings from formatting changes alone), and systematic action bias (100% false positive rates in failing models). Parameter count shows no correlation with capability in this range-a 3.8B model matches 7B models while other 7B models fail completely. Fine-tuning on 200 synthetic examples improves models with partial capability by 12-37 percentage points. We demonstrate that temporal constraint satisfaction cannot be reliably learned through next-token prediction on natural language, even with targeted fine-tuning. This capability requires architectural mechanisms for: (1) continuous temporal state representation, (2) explicit constraint checking separate from linguistic pattern matching, (3) systematic compositional reasoning over temporal relations. Current autoregressive architectures lack these mechanisms. Deploying such systems in time-critical applications without hybrid architectures incorporating symbolic reasoning modules represents unacceptable risk.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了谱神经符号推理框架，引入了三种基于语义的增强：基于transformer的节点合并、句子级蕴含验证和外部知识图谱对齐，在不改变核心推理引擎的情况下提升图质量和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱神经符号推理框架在节点冗余、边质量不高和上下文缺失方面存在不足，需要通过语义增强来提升推理的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出三种语义增强方法：(1)使用上下文嵌入进行transformer节点合并减少冗余；(2)使用预训练NLI分类器进行句子级蕴含验证改善边质量；(3)与外部知识图谱对齐补充缺失上下文。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank和CLUTRR基准测试上取得一致准确率提升（最高+3.8%），改进对对抗性案例的泛化能力，减少推理噪声。

Conclusion: 通过在谱推理阶段之前进行语义和符号细化，实现了高效、可解释且可扩展的推理，无需依赖二次注意力机制，构建了更适合开放域和实际部署的鲁棒推理系统。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

Motivation: 大语言模型在多目标对齐中面临手动指定偏好权重的挑战，这既增加了用户负担，又因探索无关偏好组合而导致训练效率低下。

Method: 提出PRO框架，包含轻量级偏好适配器，通过在多奖励模型的偏好响应上训练，自动学习每个提示的适当偏好权重。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法在多目标对齐场景中优于固定偏好权重，多个任务的广泛实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PRO框架通过自动推断提示特定偏好权重，有效解决了多目标对齐中的偏好指定问题，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的专利嵌入框架，通过利用同一文档内的多个视图（如摘要、权利要求、背景等部分）来学习更好的专利表示，解决了SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上产生过于均匀嵌入的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SimCSE风格dropout增强在专利数据上的特定失败模式：产生过于均匀的嵌入，失去语义凝聚力。

Method: 提出基于部分的增强方法，将专利的不同部分（摘要、权利要求、背景等）作为互补视图，引入自然的语义和结构多样性。

Result: 在大规模基准测试中，这种完全自监督的方法在现有技术检索和分类任务上匹配或超越了基于引用和IPC监督的基线方法，同时避免了对脆弱或不完整注释的依赖。

Conclusion: 不同专利部分专门用于不同任务——权利要求和摘要有利于检索，而背景部分有助于分类，突显了专利固有语篇结构在表示学习中的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

Motivation: 现有的演示选择方法主要关注测试输入与演示之间的语义相似性，往往忽略了标签分布对齐的重要性，这限制了大型语言模型在文本分类中的性能。

Method: 提出两阶段演示选择方法：首先基于语义相似性选择TopK候选演示，然后使用微调的BERT类小型语言模型生成标签分布并计算标签分布散度，选择与测试输入标签分布对齐的演示。

Result: 在七个文本分类基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于先前的演示选择策略。进一步分析显示，大型语言模型的性能与用于标签分布估计的小型语言模型的准确性呈正相关。

Conclusion: 结合语义相似性和标签分布对齐的演示选择方法能有效提升大型语言模型在文本分类任务中的上下文学习性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一任务、有限模型和英文报告，需要评估开源LLM在多疾病、多语言、多机构临床记录中的结构化信息提取能力。

Method: 使用15个开源LLM（包括通用和医学专用模型），在6种疾病案例中测试6种提示策略（零样本、单样本、少样本、思维链、自一致性和提示图），采用任务相关指标和混合效应模型分析性能差异。

Result: 表现最佳的模型在各项任务中接近人工标注一致性，中小型通用模型与大型模型性能相当，提示图和少样本提示可提升约13%性能，任务特定因素比模型大小或提示策略影响更大。

Conclusion: 开源LLM能够跨疾病、语言和机构从临床报告中提取结构化数据，为临床数据管理提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Motivation: 传统通用压缩器计算开销低、速度快、适用性广但压缩率较差，而现代神经压缩器能更好建模数据分布但泛化能力不足。为解决这一局限性，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用加权专家乘积(wPoE)框架，在推理时自适应地结合通用压缩模型和预训练神经语言模型，确保压缩率不低于最佳单个模型。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法无需微调即可提升文本压缩性能，并能与任何自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强跨不同数据分布的文本压缩提供了实用解决方案，成功结合了传统压缩器和神经压缩器的优势。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自监督框架，通过使用释义集和偏斜感知聚合策略来提高防护模型的语义鲁棒性，减少语义变异性约58%，并改善模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防护模型对表面语言变化的敏感性是其关键漏洞，即使意义保留的释义也会导致安全评分的大幅波动，揭示了缺乏语义基础的问题。

Method: 引入实用的自监督框架，利用释义集通过新颖的偏斜感知聚合策略来强制预测一致性，用于鲁棒目标计算。

Result: 方法在六个开源防护模型上测试，减少语义变异性约58%，平均提高基准准确率约2.5%，并能泛化到未见过的风格变化。同时发现模型校准与一致性之间存在双向关系，鲁棒性训练可将校准提高达40%。

Conclusion: 将语义一致性作为首要训练目标具有重要价值，为构建更可靠的防护模型提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

*Sichao Li,Xinyue Xu,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了STaDS框架，通过结构化表格决策模拟来评估LLMs的真实理解能力，发现大多数前沿模型在不同领域难以保持一致的准确性，且存在预测准确性与决策因素依赖不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs虽然预测准确率高，但正确性并不等同于真正的理解能力。需要评估模型是否能像人类专家一样，在多个实例和不同领域中做出一致、有依据的决策，并依赖相关的领域基础决策因素。

Method: 引入结构化表格决策模拟(STaDS)套件，将LLMs视为专业人士进行结构化决策"考试"。通过三个维度联合评估理解能力：(i)问题和指令理解，(ii)基于知识的预测，(iii)对相关决策因素的依赖。分析了9个前沿LLMs在15个不同决策场景中的表现。

Result: 研究发现：(a)大多数模型在不同领域中难以实现一致的强准确性；(b)模型可能准确但全局不忠实，存在陈述理由与驱动预测因素之间的频繁不匹配。

Conclusion: 需要开发全局层面的理解评估协议，并倡导超越准确性的新框架，以增强LLMs的理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了传统机器学习与深度迁移学习在预测儿童人工耳蜗植入后语言发展方面的表现，发现基于双线性注意力融合策略的深度迁移学习模型在准确率、敏感性和特异性方面均优于传统机器学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工耳蜗植入显著改善了重度感音神经性听力损失儿童的口语能力，但结果变异性较大，且无法通过植入年龄或残余听力可靠预测个体儿童的结果。

Method: 研究纳入278名植入儿童，使用基于脑神经解剖特征的传统机器学习和深度迁移学习算法，构建高语言改善者与低语言改善者的二元分类预测模型。

Result: 深度迁移学习预测模型达到92.39%的准确率、91.22%的敏感性和93.56%的特异性，AUC为0.977，在所有结果指标上均优于传统机器学习模型。

Conclusion: 深度迁移学习通过直接捕获判别性和任务特定信息，显著提升了预测性能，支持开发适用于全球人工耳蜗项目的单一预测模型的可行性。

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码转换语音翻译面临语义建模复杂和高质量数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法依赖模型隐式学习语义且需要昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 使用MoE语音投影器，每个专家专注于特定语言的语义子空间；采用多阶段训练范式，利用单语ASR和ST数据；结合语言特定损失、组内负载均衡损失和过渡损失进行训练。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过MoE结构和多阶段训练有效解决了代码转换语音翻译的挑战，无需依赖大量人工标注数据。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning的新方法，通过三种核心机制系统性地增强多模态大语言模型的视觉事实一致性，显著减少视觉幻觉问题，同时保持通用多模态理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题严重影响了其可靠性，现有的微调方法改进有限，未能深入干预事实推理过程。

Method: GVF通过三种核心机制整合显式事实信号：事实锚点数据增强（丰富训练数据）、事实感知指令调优（嵌入显式指令）和事实一致性损失函数（专门惩罚事实不准确）。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-13B模型上评估，GVF在VHTest基准测试中显著优于标准微调，同时在MME和POPE等通用多模态基准上保持或略有提升性能。

Conclusion: GVF Finetuning有效缓解了视觉幻觉问题，且不损害模型的通用理解和推理能力，为提升多模态模型的可靠性提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: SpiderGen是一个基于LLM的工作流，结合传统生命周期评估（LCA）的分类和方法论，利用LLM的推理能力和世界知识生成用于LCA的程序信息，显著降低了LCA的成本和时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化和全球变暖主要由温室气体排放引起，而消费品生产、使用和处置是重要排放源。需要构建工具来评估消费品的环境影响，其中生命周期评估（LCA）是关键组成部分。

Method: 提出SpiderGen工作流，将传统LCA的分类和方法论与LLM的推理能力和世界知识相结合，生成LCA所需的程序信息。

Result: SpiderGen提供准确或仅有轻微错误的LCA过程信息，在10个样本数据点上达到62%的F1分数。相比现有LCA方法（成本超过25000美元，耗时21人天），SpiderGen能在10分钟内以低于1美元的成本生成LCA过程信息。

Conclusion: SpiderGen在减少估算碳影响的人力和成本方面具有巨大潜力，性能优于思维链提示和单样本提示等基线技术。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Motivation: 调查不同大语言模型对齐方法如何影响模型对提示攻击的响应，评估现有攻击基准测试的充分性。

Method: 选择基于SFT、DPO和RLHF对齐方法的开源模型，使用统计方法系统分析攻击成功率对提示变异的敏感性。

Result: 即使小的提示修改也能显著改变攻击成功率，使模型对不同类型的攻击更加或更不敏感。现有攻击基准测试可能无法完全揭示模型和对齐方法的所有漏洞。

Conclusion: 需要基于统计的系统性分析来评估不同对齐方法及其攻击成功率对提示变异的敏感性，这对模型攻击评估工作具有重要贡献。

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型应用范围扩大，用户与模型的交互频率和规模增加，需要评估模型在真实世界任务中的鲁棒性，特别是在多轮对话场景下的稳定性。

Method: 使用简单的多轮后续提示评估模型答案变化，通过马尔可夫链分析模型准确率动态变化，并检验线性探针是否能预测这些变化。

Result: 发现显著漏洞："再想想"提示导致Gemini 1.5 Flash准确率下降约10%；结合语义等效重述问题使Claude 3.5 Haiku准确率下降7.5%；马尔可夫链能有效建模准确率动态，预测长期准确率比首轮低约8%；线性探针可预测未来答案变化。

Conclusion: 建立稳态准确率作为交互场景的鲁棒性指标，暴露了模型在重复提问下的脆弱性，解决这种不稳定性对于在高风险交互场景中部署LLM至关重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

Motivation: 研究动机是调查递归提示生成合成数据时可能导致的偏见放大风险，特别是在性别偏见方面，以及如何有效缓解这种偏见。

Method: 采用三种互补的评估框架：基于规则的模式匹配、基于嵌入的语义相似性和下游任务性能，在三种初始偏见水平（0.1、0.3、0.6）和四种缓解策略下进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示低初始偏见会向模型固有偏见水平放大（+36%），而高初始偏见会衰减（-26%）。对比增强方法能显著减少下游偏见（低初始偏见下减少98.8%，平均减少91%），尽管会产生更高的嵌入偏见分数。

Conclusion: 语义相似性指标可能与行为公平结果存在分歧，强调了在负责任合成数据生成中进行多维评估的必要性。

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有基准测试难以跟上大语言模型的发展速度，存在数据污染问题，且大多假设良性、资源丰富的环境，缺乏对模型在压力下行为的评估。

Method: 设计了包含六个淘汰赛级别的动态对抗性评估环境Squid Game，评估模型在指令遵循、代码、推理、规划和安全对齐等多方面能力，让LLM与其他LLM对手进行交互式游戏。

Result: 评估了50多个LLM，观察到同一模型谱系中明显的代际性能跃迁，发现某些模型采用投机性捷径获胜，表明静态基准可能存在更高级别的评估范式污染。

Conclusion: 动态评估可以作为静态评估的补充部分，Squid Game提供了评估LLM在动态对抗场景下行为的新方法。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

### [108] [$π$-Attention: Periodic Sparse Transformers for Efficient Long-Context Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10696)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ΠAttention是一种周期性稀疏Transformer，通过将注意力分解为环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，在保持线性复杂度的同时扩展了感受野，在语言建模等任务中优于RingAttention。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次复杂度限制了长序列建模能力，现有的稀疏注意力机制如RingAttention虽然降低了计算成本，但存在感受野有限和缺乏适应性的问题。

Method: 提出ΠAttention，将注意力分解为三个组件：环形局部邻域、确定性π步长跳跃和自适应融合门，通过周期性结构提供对远距离token的预测性覆盖。

Result: ΠAttention在语言建模、检索和视觉语言任务中达到或超过密集注意力的质量，困惑度比RingAttention低8.3%，相同上下文长度下GPU使用量减少50%。

Conclusion: 周期性跳跃、自适应融合和头级稀疏协调对于高效长上下文建模至关重要，ΠAttention在保持线性复杂度的同时显著扩展了感受野。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合TextRank句子提取和医疗命名实体识别的框架，使用LLaMA-2-7B模型在英语和孟加拉语医疗问答数据集上微调，显著提升了医疗文本摘要的忠实度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗文本摘要中的不忠实摘要可能误传医疗细节，带来严重风险，需要确保医疗信息准确性的摘要方法。

Method: 结合TextRank句子提取和医疗命名实体识别，使用LLaMA-2-7B模型在MeQSum和BanglaCHQ-Summ数据集上进行微调。

Result: 在质量指标（ROUGE、BERTScore、可读性）和忠实度指标（SummaC、AlignScore）上取得一致改进，超过零样本基线和先前系统，80%以上生成摘要保留了关键医疗信息。

Conclusion: 忠实度是可靠医疗摘要的关键维度，该方法展示了在医疗环境中更安全部署LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型越来越多地用于教育任务如评分，但其在真实课堂环境中与人类评估的一致性仍缺乏充分研究。

Method: 收集约50名学生的五次测验回答和14个团队的项目报告，使用GPT-4o进行评分，并与助教的独立人工评分进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o与人类评分员显示出强相关性（最高0.98），55%的测验案例得分完全一致。在项目报告中总体表现良好，但在技术性、开放式回答的评分上存在一定变异性。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了基于LLM的评分系统的潜力和局限性，为推进真实学术环境中的自动评分做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

TL;DR: 该研究通过训练不同多语言数据混合的LLMs，使用跨层转码器和归因图分析其内部机制，发现多语言LLMs采用枢轴语言表示机制：模型使用几乎相同的跨语言表示，而语言特定的解码出现在后层。归因分析显示解码部分依赖于最后一层中的高频语言特征，这些特征从模型第一层线性读取语言身份。通过干预这些特征，可以抑制一种语言并在模型输出中替换另一种语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言大语言模型内部如何表示语言多样性，探索它们是否形成共享的多语言表示和语言特定的解码机制，以及为什么性能仍然偏向主导训练语言。

Method: 训练一系列不同多语言数据混合的LLMs，使用跨层转码器(CLT)和归因图分析内部机制，通过干预语言特征来验证机制。

Result: 发现枢轴语言表示机制：模型采用几乎相同的跨语言表示，语言特定解码出现在后层；解码依赖于最后一层的高频语言特征，这些特征从第一层线性读取语言身份；通过干预这些特征可以控制语言输出。

Conclusion: 理解枢轴语言机制对于改进LLMs中的多语言对齐至关重要，这有助于解释为什么模型性能偏向主导训练语言，并为改善多语言能力提供方向。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了情感识别模型在非洲裔美国白话英语(AAVE)和通用美国英语(GAE)上的性能差异，发现模型在AAVE文本上对愤怒情绪的误报率显著高于GAE，存在种族偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感识别模型主要基于主流文化规范的标注数据，难以准确识别AAVE等被排除在训练数据之外的方言中的情感表达，这可能导致对特定群体的偏见。

Method: 研究分析了270万条洛杉矶地理标记推文，使用计算方法评估AAVE特征强度，并在875条推文数据集上收集情感存在和强度标注，采用社区知情标注方法。

Result: GPT和BERT模型在AAVE上的愤怒误报率比GAE高出一倍多；SpanEmo模型在AAVE上的愤怒误报率从25%上升到60%；模型与非内部群体标注与粗俗语AAVE特征显著相关；非洲裔居民比例较高的社区与更高的愤怒预测相关。

Conclusion: 情感AI通过有偏见的情感分类强化种族刻板印象，存在新兴安全问题，需要开发文化和方言知情的情感计算系统。

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务算术在大型语言模型间传输技能时，常因模型训练过程中的参数空间发散而遭受负干扰，限制了其实际应用效果。

Method: 首先对齐模型的参数空间，利用Transformer架构固有的排列、旋转和缩放对称性，针对现代GQA和SwiGLU层进行参数空间对齐，探索基于权重和基于激活的两种方法。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法始终优于标准任务算术，成功将高级推理技能传输到非推理模型中。

Conclusion: 该工作为在不断发展的LLM家族之间合并和传输专业技能提供了有效方法，减少了冗余的微调并增强了模型适应性。

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各种任务中被用作评判者，特别是在涉及日常社交互动的任务中，需要了解LLM评判者能否可靠评估需要社交或对话判断的任务。

Method: 通过将任务从直接事实查询重新构建为对话判断任务，对比模型在直接事实查询和最小对话中评估说话者正确性的表现，并施加简单反驳的压力来测试模型立场的坚定性。

Result: 研究发现，GPT-4o-mini等模型在社交框架任务中表现出奉承倾向，而Llama-8B-Instruct等模型则变得过于挑剔，所有模型的平均性能变化为9.24%。

Conclusion: 对话框架是LLM评估的关键因素，提出的框架为诊断模型信念提供了可重复的方法，有助于开发更可信的对话系统。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型存在格式层面的负向偏见，即提示格式比负向响应的语义更能影响模型回答。当模型缺乏足够知识回答是非问题时，会倾向于生成负向响应，导致负向偏见。提供相关上下文和"我不知道"选项可减少偏见，而思维链提示会放大偏见。

Method: 引入构建评估集的流程，将数据集系统分类为正确、错误和知识不足三个子集。分析不同提示场景下负向偏见的变化，包括提供相关上下文、"我不知道"选项和思维链提示。

Result: 发现模型在缺乏足够知识时会通过捷径行为生成负向响应，导致负向偏见。提供相关上下文和"我不知道"选项能减少偏见，思维链提示会放大偏见，不同提示类型会影响偏见程度。

Conclusion: 揭示了影响负向偏见的多种因素，为减轻大语言模型中的负向偏见提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了工具增强语言模型(TaLMs)在使用代码解释器工具时出现的工具诱导短视(TIM)问题，即模型将工具输出作为推理的替代品，导致解决方案看似正确但缺乏连贯的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TaLMs能够调用外部工具来解决超出其参数能力的问题，但这些工具带来的性能提升是否反映了可信的推理过程尚不清楚。作者旨在验证工具使用是否会导致推理质量的下降。

Method: 开发了PYMATH基准测试(包含1,679个竞赛级数学问题)，建立了多维评估套件来量化TaLMs相对于非工具对应模型的推理退化。还提出了基于偏好优化的框架来重新调整TaLMs将工具作为辅助证据使用。

Result: 研究发现TaLMs在最终答案准确率上提升了19.3个百分点，但其推理行为持续恶化(非工具LLMs在推理过程比较中胜出高达41.5%)。工具使用越频繁，推理连贯性越差，错误从算术错误转向全局推理失败。

Conclusion: 工具使用虽然提高了最终答案准确率，但损害了推理质量。提出的偏好优化框架能够改善工具使用下的最终答案准确率和推理深度。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use. Codes and data are available at: https://github.com/megagonlabs/TIM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

The system integrates seamlessly into existing academic writing platforms, providing interactive interfaces for real-time feedback and revision tracking. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system in generating more comprehensive and useful reviews aligned with expert standards, surpassing ablated baselines and advancing transparent, human-centered scholarly assistance.

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Motivation: 当前翻译评估方法主要关注句子级别的准确性和流畅性，无法充分评估专业领域翻译所需的语篇级连贯性和术语精确性。

Method: 构建DiscoX基准数据集，包含7个专业领域的200篇专业文本；开发Metric-S无参考评估系统，提供准确性、流畅性和适当性的细粒度评估。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对流行的开源DPO数据集进行了首次全面的数据中心分析，使用Magpie框架标注样本的任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励，并基于分析结果构建了新的DPO混合数据集UltraMix。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数前沿LLM不公开其策划的偏好对，而开源DPO数据集缺乏系统比较，主要由于高计算成本和缺乏丰富的质量注释，难以理解偏好如何选择、涵盖哪些任务类型以及它们在每个样本级别上如何反映人类判断。

Method: 使用Magpie框架对每个样本进行任务类别、输入质量和偏好奖励的标注，通过奖励模型验证偏好顺序，实现跨数据集的可扩展细粒度偏好质量检查。基于这些洞察，从五个语料库中有选择地构建新的DPO混合数据集UltraMix，同时移除噪声或冗余样本。

Result: UltraMix比性能最佳的单数据集小30%，但在关键基准测试中表现更优。揭示了不同数据集在奖励边际方面的结构和质量差异。

Conclusion: 通过数据中心的偏好优化方法，可以构建更高效的DPO数据集，UltraMix在减少数据集规模的同时提升了性能，为未来的数据中心偏好优化研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

*Xingyu Ren,Youran Sun,Haoyu Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现当前文本嵌入模型存在一致的偏差，并提出了一种无需训练、轻量级的重归一化解决方案，显著提升了MMTEB基准测试中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有文本嵌入模型的输出存在系统性偏差，即所有嵌入向量都包含一个几乎相同的偏差分量μ，这影响了模型的性能表现。

Method: 提出重归一化方法，有两种变体：直接从嵌入向量中减去偏差μ，或减去嵌入向量在μ方向上的投影。该方法无需训练且轻量级。

Result: 在38个模型上的实验表明，重归一化在检索任务上提升9.7σ，分类任务提升3.1σ，其他任务提升0.8σ。理论预测和实验都证实投影方法效果更好。

Conclusion: 重归一化是一种有效的训练后处理方法，能够显著提升文本嵌入模型的性能，特别是投影方法表现更优。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Motivation: 大型语言模型能生成流畅回答但有时会产生事实幻觉，研究目的是探索LLMs能否检测自身的幻觉问题。

Method: 将幻觉检测构建为句子分类任务，提出评估框架和基于思维链的分类方法，从模型参数中提取知识进行检测。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-3.5 Turbo配合思维链方法能够检测58.2%的自身幻觉。

Conclusion: 当模型参数包含足够知识时，配备思维链的LLMs能够检测到自身产生的幻觉。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过现代语言模型的任务特定适应来更好地理解和分析政治沟通中的人身攻击现象。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在常见条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识的上下文场景中难以有效利用长上下文信息，主要受限于模型上下文窗口和大量上下文噪声中相关信息稀疏的问题。

Method: 提出SAP$^{2}$方法，采用两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词的框架，每个阶段利用语音驱动的基于注意力的池化机制，有效压缩上下文嵌入同时保留语音显著信息。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上达到最先进性能，词错误率分别为7.71%和1.12%。在SlideSpeech上，相比非上下文基线，偏置关键词错误率显著降低41.1%。

Conclusion: SAP$^{2}$方法在广泛上下文输入条件下在两个数据集上都表现出稳健的可扩展性，能够持续保持性能。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于语言学理论、经过实证验证的副词超义类型学，扩展了WordNet对副词的语义分类覆盖，并展示了该分类在自然文本中的广泛应用和可靠标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WordNet为名词和动词提供了丰富的超义层次结构，但副词缺乏系统的语义分类，这限制了其在自然语言处理应用中的效用。

Method: 开发了一个基于语言学理论的副词超义类型学，通过标注研究进行实证验证，涵盖方式、时间、频率、程度、领域、说话者导向和主语导向等主要语义域。

Result: 试点标注研究表明，这些类别能够广泛覆盖自然文本中的副词，并且可以由人类标注者可靠地分配。

Conclusion: 该类型学扩展了WordNet的覆盖范围，使其更贴近语言学理论，并促进了词义消歧、事件抽取、情感分析和语篇建模等下游NLP应用。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析中存在关键挑战，它们往往过度拟合全局句子表示，无法捕捉局部语义细节。

Method: 提出LANE对抗训练策略，通过选择性标记训练集中的替代词生成挑战性负例，迫使模型在相同句子不同标记词之间创建更大可分性。该方法与模型无关，可集成到现有表示学习框架中。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准测试中，该方法产生了更具区分性的词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。定性分析显示，所提出的负例即使在挑战性环境中也能更好地捕捉细微意义差异。

Conclusion: LANE方法通过对抗训练有效提升了神经语言模型在细粒度词义解析中的表现，生成更具区分性的词表示。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可扩展性、语言质量和事实一致性方面存在不足，需要一种能高效生成高质量问答对的方法来支持教育平台和大型语言模型的开发测试。

Method: 首先基于关系对KG三元组进行聚类，创建可重用的自然语言模板；然后使用LLM优化模板以提高清晰度和连贯性；最后通过从KG中选择干扰项来实例化答案选项。

Result: 实验证明这种混合方法能高效生成高质量的问答对，兼具可扩展性、流畅性和语言精确性。

Conclusion: 该混合方法成功解决了KG到QA转换中的可扩展性和语言质量问题，为教育平台和LLM测试提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

*Wei Fan,JinYi Yoon,Bo Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iMAD是一个智能多智能体辩论框架，通过选择性触发辩论来显著减少计算成本，同时提高答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论框架对所有查询都进行辩论，导致计算成本高且可能降低准确性。iMAD旨在仅在可能有益时触发辩论，以纠正初始错误答案。

Method: iMAD首先让单个智能体生成结构化自我批评响应，从中提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征来捕捉犹豫线索。然后使用轻量级辩论决策分类器（采用FocusCal损失训练）决定是否触发多智能体辩论。

Result: 在六个（视觉）问答数据集上对五个竞争基线进行的实验表明，iMAD显著减少了token使用（最高达92%），同时提高了最终答案准确性（最高达13.5%）。

Conclusion: iMAD通过智能选择性地触发多智能体辩论，实现了计算效率和准确性的双重提升，为LLM智能体系统提供了更高效的推理框架。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在金融NLP应用中计算需求高、可访问性受限的问题，使更多组织能够部署先进的金融NLP技术。

Method: LAET策略通过分析隐藏状态表示，选择性微调预训练LLM中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层，显著降低计算开销。

Result: 在金融NLP任务中表现出强劲结果，超越了现有基准和最先进的LLM（如GPT-4），即使使用较小的LLM（约30亿参数）也能实现优异性能。

Conclusion: LAET成功弥合了前沿金融NLP研究与实际部署之间的差距，为金融应用提供了高效且可扩展的模型解决方案。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型与人类婴儿在语言学习能力上的差异，特别是对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现。

Method: 回顾文献分析语言模型对自然语言和不可能语言的学习表现，比较其与人类婴儿的差异。

Result: 语言模型通常能同等学习自然语言和许多不可能语言，难以学习的不可能语言只是更复杂或随机。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种主动式听力助手系统，能够自动识别和分离佩戴者的对话伙伴，无需明确提示，在嘈杂环境中实时运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够主动适应对话动态的听力助手，无需用户明确提示即可识别对话伙伴并抑制其他声音，提升多对话环境下的听觉体验。

Method: 使用双模型架构：轻量级流式模型每12.5毫秒运行一次用于低延迟提取对话伙伴，较慢模型运行频率较低以捕捉长程对话动态。基于自我语音作为锚点，利用轮换行为和对话动态推断对话伙伴。

Result: 在真实世界2人和3人对话测试集上验证有效，收集了11名参与者的6.8小时双耳自我中心音频数据，显示在多对话环境中能够泛化识别和隔离对话伙伴。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着向主动适应对话动态和参与的听力助手迈出了重要一步，实现了在设备上实时运行的能力。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Motivation: 现有学术基准测试无法充分评估模型在现实世界专业环境中的表现，特别是在法律和金融等高风险领域，这些领域的实际回报至关重要。

Method: 招募182名持有JD、CFA证书或6年以上经验的专业人士，基于实际工作流程创建任务，并通过独立专家验证的质量管道验证评分标准。

Result: 对20个领先模型的评估显示，在Hard子集上最高得分仅为0.39（金融）和0.37（法律），表明模型在这些专业领域仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 模型在专业推理方面存在显著不足，常见失败模式包括判断不准确、缺乏过程透明度和推理不完整，这些差距阻碍了模型在专业领域的可靠采用。

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: AccKV是一个针对音频-视频大语言模型的高效推理优化框架，通过自适应聚焦和交叉校准技术解决多模态KV缓存管理问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视频大语言模型在处理时态数据时会产生较大的KV缓存，现有优化策略基于任务选择性地保留音频或视频缓存，但实验发现高层注意力更偏向视频模态，且直接整合音频和视频的KV缓存会导致信息混淆和性能下降。

Method: 提出AccKV框架，包含层自适应聚焦技术（根据层特性选择性关注关键模态，通过注意力重新分配增强重要token识别）和交叉校准技术（先整合模态内低效KV缓存，然后将低优先级模态与高优先级模态对齐，选择性淘汰低优先级模态的KV缓存）。

Result: 实验结果表明AccKV能够显著提升AV-LLMs的计算效率，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: AccKV通过自适应聚焦和交叉校准技术有效解决了AV-LLMs中多模态KV缓存管理问题，为高效的多模态大语言模型推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: 端到端多模态推荐在真实工业场景中具有优越性，LEMUR的成功验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.

Motivation: 随着群组活动的日益普及，需要开发基于群组成员集体偏好的群组推荐方法。现有方法常因数据稀疏性和高维性而表现不佳。

Method: 使用软填充奇异值分解(SVD)进行低秩矩阵补全，处理稀疏高维数据。

Result: 在Goodbooks、Movielens和合成数据集上，该方法在小用户群组中召回率优于基于群组矩阵分解的基线方法，在所有群组规模下均取得可比结果，且恢复的矩阵秩更低。

Conclusion: Group Soft-Impute SVD方法能有效处理高维数据，在群组推荐任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing popularity of group activities increased the need to develop methods for providing recommendations to a group of users based on the collective preferences of the group members. Several group recommender systems have been proposed, but these methods often struggle due to sparsity and high-dimensionality of the available data, common in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a group recommender system called Group Soft-Impute SVD, which leverages soft-impute singular value decomposition to enhance group recommendations. This approach addresses the challenge of sparse high-dimensional data using low-rank matrix completion. We compared the performance of Group Soft-Impute SVD with Group MF based approaches and found that our method outperforms the baselines in recall for small user groups while achieving comparable results across all group sizes when tasked on Goodbooks, Movielens, and Synthetic datasets. Furthermore, our method recovers lower matrix ranks than the baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正-未标记学习在欺诈检测和医疗诊断等高风险领域面临独特挑战，主要是缺乏明确标记的负样本，同时需要应对数据稀缺和隐私约束。

Method: 为每种源域类型构建定制逻辑回归模型，通过模型平均将知识迁移到PU目标域，使用交叉验证准则最小化Kullback-Leibler散度来确定最优权重。

Conclusion: 该方法在预测准确性和鲁棒性方面优于其他比较方法，特别是在有限标记数据和异构环境下表现突出。

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning presents unique challenges due to the lack of explicitly labeled negative samples, particularly in high-stakes domains such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis. To address data scarcity and privacy constraints, we propose a novel transfer learning with model averaging framework that integrates information from heterogeneous data sources - including fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU data sets - without direct data sharing. For each source domain type, a tailored logistic regression model is conducted, and knowledge is transferred to the PU target domain through model averaging. Optimal weights for combining source models are determined via a cross-validation criterion that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish theoretical guarantees for weight optimality and convergence, covering both misspecified and correctly specified target models, with further extensions to high-dimensional settings using sparsity-penalized estimators. Extensive simulations and real-world credit risk data analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative methods in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness, especially under limited labeled data and heterogeneous environments.

Motivation: 线性模型在高风险决策中广泛使用，但引入公平性约束后，其对模型系数的影响不透明。现有方法依赖强假设或忽视敏感属性的明确作用，限制了公平性评估的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型审计和缓解提供了可操作的见解，实现了对公平性干预的透明、特征级解释。

Abstract: Linear models are widely used in high-stakes decision-making due to their simplicity and interpretability. Yet when fairness constraints such as demographic parity are introduced, their effects on model coefficients, and thus on how predictive bias is distributed across features, remain opaque. Existing approaches on linear models often rely on strong and unrealistic assumptions, or overlook the explicit role of the sensitive attribute, limiting their practical utility for fairness assessment. We extend the work of (Chzhen and Schreuder, 2022) and (Fukuchi and Sakuma, 2023) by proposing a post-processing framework that can be applied on top of any linear model to decompose the resulting bias into direct (sensitive-attribute) and indirect (correlated-features) components. Our method analytically characterizes how demographic parity reshapes each model coefficient, including those of both sensitive and non-sensitive features. This enables a transparent, feature-level interpretation of fairness interventions and reveals how bias may persist or shift through correlated variables. Our framework requires no retraining and provides actionable insights for model auditing and mitigation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method captures fairness dynamics missed by prior work, offering a practical and interpretable tool for responsible deployment of linear models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出LT-Soups框架，解决参数高效微调方法在长尾数据分布中头尾类性能权衡问题，通过两阶段模型融合方法在不同不平衡场景下实现更好的性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常呈现长尾分布，现有参数高效微调方法在保持尾类性能时会牺牲头类精度，且头尾类比例这一关键因素被忽视。

Method: 提出LT-Soups两阶段框架：第一阶段在平衡子集上微调模型并平均以减少头类偏差；第二阶段仅在完整数据集上微调分类器以恢复头类精度。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，LT-Soups在广泛的不平衡场景下相比PEFT和传统模型融合方法实现了更优的性能权衡。

Conclusion: LT-Soups框架能够有效解决长尾数据分布中的头尾类性能权衡问题，在不同不平衡场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的B样条近似和递归导数计算，显著提高了拉格朗日系统识别在噪声环境下的鲁棒性和准确性，为复杂非线性动力系统的数据驱动发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

### [152] [Bias-Restrained Prefix Representation Finetuning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10707)
*Sirui Liang,Pengfei Cao,Jian Zhao,Cong Huang,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出BREP ReFT方法，通过优化推理前缀生成、干预早期推理阶段和约束干预向量幅度，解决了ReFT在数学推理任务上性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReFT方法在数学推理任务上表现显著下降，主要原因是难以生成有效的推理前缀，且干扰数值编码导致错误在CoT阶段累积。

Method: 提出BREP ReFT方法：1）截断训练数据优化初始推理前缀生成；2）干预早期推理阶段防止错误累积；3）约束干预向量幅度避免干扰数值编码。

Result: 在多种模型架构上的广泛实验表明，BREP在数学推理任务上优于标准ReFT和基于权重的PEFT方法，具有更好的有效性、效率和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BREP ReFT成功解决了ReFT在数学推理任务上的性能瓶颈，在保持高效的同时显著提升了数学推理能力。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

### [153] [Towards Uncertainty Quantification in Generative Model Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10710)
*Giorgio Morales,Frederic Jurie,Jalal Fadili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出生成模型学习中不确定性量化的问题，讨论了基于集成方法的精度-召回曲线等研究方向，并在合成数据集上验证了聚合精度-召回曲线在捕捉模型近似不确定性方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在各个领域日益普及，但其可靠性存在根本性担忧。当前评估方法主要关注学习分布与目标分布之间的接近程度，而忽略了这些测量中的固有不确定性。

Method: 形式化生成模型学习中的不确定性量化问题，提出使用基于集成方法的精度-召回曲线来量化不确定性。

Result: 在合成数据集上的初步实验表明，聚合精度-召回曲线能够有效捕捉模型近似不确定性，使基于不确定性特征对不同模型架构进行系统比较成为可能。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化是生成模型评估中一个关键但被忽视的方面，提出的方法为系统比较不同模型架构的不确定性特征提供了有效工具。

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

*James Hazelden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迹估计的矩阵自由方法，用于快速计算神经正切核(NTK)的迹、Frobenius范数、有效秩和对齐度，避免了计算完整NTK矩阵的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算完整的NTK矩阵对于循环架构等复杂模型通常不可行，需要一种更高效的NTK分析方法。

Method: 使用Hutch++迹估计器进行矩阵自由计算，并提出了仅需前向或反向自动微分的单边估计器。

Result: 矩阵自由随机化方法可以实现多个数量级的加速，在低样本情况下单边估计器表现优于Hutch++。

Conclusion: 矩阵自由随机化方法能够显著加速NTK的分析和应用，特别是在模型状态与参数数量差距较大时。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

### [155] [Private Zeroth-Order Optimization with Public Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10859)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署一阶差分隐私机器学习算法（如DP-SGD）存在高计算和内存成本的问题，而现有的零阶方法虽然更容易实现隐私保护，但效用相对较低且应用领域有限。

Method: 提出PAZO框架，利用公开信息来指导和改进私有零阶算法的梯度近似，开发了一套具有最小开销的公开数据辅助零阶优化器。

Result: PAZO在视觉和文本任务中，在预训练和微调设置下都实现了优越的隐私/效用权衡，特别是在高隐私保护机制下优于最佳的一阶基线方法，同时提供高达16倍运行速度提升。

Conclusion: 利用公开数据辅助的零阶优化方法能够有效解决差分隐私机器学习中的计算效率问题，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

### [156] [Near-optimal Linear Predictive Clustering in Non-separable Spaces via Mixed Integer Programming and Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Reductions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10809)
*Jiazhou Liang,Hassan Khurram,Scott Sanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种改进线性预测聚类（LPC）全局优化的新方法，通过利用可分离性的理论特性，推导出具有可证明误差界的近似最优解，显著降低了混合整数规划（MIP）的复杂性并提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LPC方法存在局限性：贪婪优化方法缺乏全局最优性，在非可分聚类设置中表现不佳；而MIP方法虽然能保证全局最优性但可扩展性差。本文旨在改进约束优化范式，提高LPC全局优化的效率。

Method: 1. 利用可分离性的关键理论特性推导近似最优解，具有可证明误差界；2. 将LPC进一步近似为二次伪布尔优化（QPBO）问题；两种方法都显著降低了MIP公式的复杂性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的比较分析表明，所提方法始终能获得近似最优解，回归误差显著低于贪婪优化方法，同时在可扩展性上优于现有的MIP公式。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在保持近似最优解的同时，显著提高了LPC全局优化的效率和可扩展性，为不可分聚类设置提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

### [157] [Transformers know more than they can tell -- Learning the Collatz sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10811)
*François Charton,Ashvni Narayanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer模型预测Collatz序列长步长的能力，发现模型准确率随编码基数变化，最高可达99.7%，最低仅25%。所有模型都学习相同的模式：按输入模2^p的余数分类学习，准确率接近完美，反映了Collatz序列的数学特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型如何学习复杂的算术函数，特别是Collatz序列的长步长预测，以理解模型学习计算控制结构的能力。

Method: 使用不同基数编码输入和输出，训练Transformer模型预测Collatz序列的长步长，分析模型学习模式和错误类型。

Result: 模型准确率随基数变化显著（99.7%到25%），学习模式一致：按模2^p余数分类学习，错误主要源于循环长度估计错误而非计算错误。

Conclusion: 学习复杂算术函数的难点在于理解计算的控制结构（循环长度），使用数学问题作为工具可以更好地理解、解释和改进语言模型。

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用多校准方法来处理图匹配问题中的预测误差，通过构建多校准预测器来补偿不完美预测器带来的误差，使基于预测权重的匹配决策能够与在原始预测器上应用的最佳决策规则竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在加权图中寻找最佳匹配时，通常只能访问基于底层上下文对实际随机权重的预测。如果预测器是贝叶斯最优的，那么基于预测权重计算最佳匹配是最优的。但在实践中，完美信息场景不现实，不完美的预测器可能导致标准最优规则表现不佳。

Method: 提出使用多校准方法，要求预测器在受保护上下文集合的每个元素上无偏。给定匹配算法类$\mathcal C$和任何边权重预测器$γ$，构建特定的多校准预测器$\hat γ$。

Result: 基于$\hat γ$输出的最佳匹配选择与在原始预测器$γ$上应用$\mathcal C$中最佳决策规则的性能相当。

Conclusion: 多校准方法能够有效补偿不完美预测器带来的误差，提供了样本复杂度界限来支持该方法。

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Conclusion: SurfaceBench通过将符号推理与几何重建相结合，为组合泛化、数据驱动的科学归纳和几何感知推理提供了原则性的基准测试平台。

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

Conclusion: 注意力是量化模型不确定性的丰富信号，为根据幻觉性质调整检测策略提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Result: 在18个基准数据集和真实世界案例研究上的实证评估表明，FlowPath相比使用固定插值或不可逆架构的基线方法，在分类准确性上实现了统计显著的持续改进。

Conclusion: FlowPath强调了不仅需要建模沿路径的动力学，还需要建模路径本身的几何形状，为从不规则时间序列中学习提供了鲁棒且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

TL;DR: ExPairT-LLM是一种用于代码选择的精确学习算法，通过向LLM提出两种新型查询（成对成员关系和成对等价性）来从多个程序中选择最佳程序，在四个流行代码数据集上平均比最先进的代码选择算法提升13.0%的pass@1成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码选择算法可能无法识别正确程序，因为它们可能错误识别不等价程序，或者依赖LLM并假设它总能正确确定每个输入的输出。

Method: ExPairT-LLM通过向LLM提出两种新型查询（成对成员关系和成对等价性）来选择程序，这些查询对LLM更简单，并通过锦标赛机制识别正确程序，对某些LLM错误具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个流行代码数据集上，ExPairT-LLM的pass@1（成功率）平均比最先进的代码选择算法高出13.0%，最高可达27.1%。同时将执行复杂推理的LLMs的pass@1提高了24.0%。

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM通过引入更简单的查询类型和锦标赛机制，显著提高了代码选择的准确性和鲁棒性，在多个数据集上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将稀疏识别非线性动力学(SINDY)算法与卡尔曼滤波(KF)相结合的新方法——SINDY卡尔曼滤波(SKF)，用于实时学习时变非线性系统的控制方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从数据中学习控制方程对于理解物理系统行为至关重要，但现有方法难以实时处理复杂时变非线性系统。需要将稀疏驱动方法与实时滤波技术相结合。

Method: 将SINDY算法与卡尔曼滤波统一，将未知系统参数视为状态变量，通过前瞻误差增强参数识别策略，简化稀疏水平、方差参数和切换时刻的估计。

Result: 在具有漂移或切换参数的混沌Lorenz系统上验证了SKF的有效性，并在真实飞行数据构建的稀疏非线性飞机模型中展示了实时识别能力。

Conclusion: SKF方法成功统一了SINDY和KF框架，能够实时推断复杂时变非线性模型，解决了单独使用任一方法无法实现的问题。

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于不完整多视图聚类的动态深度图学习方法（DGIMVCM），通过构建缺失鲁棒的全局图、图结构对比学习和掩码图重构损失来解决现有方法中的噪声问题和梯度噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多视图数据的普遍存在使得不完整多视图聚类成为重要研究方向。现有基于GNN的方法存在两个主要挑战：(1) 依赖KNN构建静态图会引入噪声并降低图拓扑的鲁棒性；(2) 使用MSE损失作为图重构损失会在优化过程中产生大量梯度噪声。

Conclusion: DGIMVCM通过动态深度图学习和掩码图重构损失有效解决了不完整多视图聚类中的噪声问题和梯度噪声问题，展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

TL;DR: LoRaCompass是一个强化学习模型，用于在未知环境中高效定位周期性广播的LoRa标签，通过空间感知特征提取器和策略蒸馏损失函数学习稳健的空间表示，结合UCB启发式探索函数，在80km²多样化环境中验证，定位成功率超过90%，搜索路径长度与初始距离呈线性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的LoRa标签定位方法容易受到域偏移和信号波动的影响，导致级联决策错误和显著的定位不准确性。需要开发一种能够在未知环境中稳健高效搜索LoRa标签的方法。

Method: 提出LoRaCompass强化学习模型，包含：1）空间感知特征提取器和策略蒸馏损失函数，从RSSI学习稳健空间表示以最大化靠近标签的概率；2）基于上置信界（UCB）的探索函数，引导传感器以递增置信度向标签移动。

Result: 在覆盖80km²的多样化未见环境中验证，LoRaCompass在100米范围内定位标签的成功率超过90%（比现有方法提高40%），搜索路径长度（以跳数计）与初始距离呈线性关系，表现出高效率和稳健性。

Conclusion: LoRaCompass通过稳健的空间表示学习和UCB启发式探索，在LoRa标签定位任务中实现了高成功率和线性可扩展的搜索效率，显著优于现有方法，适用于地面和无人机辅助场景。

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Conclusion: 所提出的零样本合成验证框架能有效节省计算资源，并支持快速超参数调整，为联邦学习提供了高效的训练终止策略。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前癌症筛查指南仅覆盖少数癌症类型，且依赖年龄或单一风险因素等狭窄标准来识别高风险人群。利用电子健康记录中大规模纵向患者健康信息构建的预测模型可能通过检测微妙的癌症前诊断信号，为识别高风险群体提供更有效的工具。

Method: 使用All of Us研究项目中超过865,000名参与者的EHR、基因组和调查数据，系统评估了基于EHR的预测模型与传统风险因素（包括基因突变和癌症家族史）在识别八种主要癌症高风险人群方面的临床效用。

Result: 即使使用基线建模方法，基于EHR的模型在识别为高风险个体中真实癌症病例的富集度比单独使用传统风险因素高出3-6倍。EHR基础模型（基于全面患者轨迹训练的最先进方法）进一步提高了对26种癌症类型的预测性能。

Conclusion: 基于EHR的预测建模具有支持更精确和可扩展的早期检测策略的临床潜力，能够显著改善癌症高风险人群的识别效果。

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

TL;DR: RETROFIT是一种无数据回顾的持续学习方法，通过参数级合并解决安全分析中模型性能退化问题，在恶意软件检测和二进制摘要任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在安全分析中面临性能退化问题，现有持续学习方法需要完整重训练或数据回放，在数据敏感环境中不可行，且存在知识保留和整合的挑战。

Method: 通过合并先前训练和新微调的模型作为新旧知识的教师，采用参数级合并避免历史数据需求；使用低秩和稀疏更新将参数变化限制在独立子空间；知识仲裁机制根据模型置信度动态平衡教师贡献。

Result: 在恶意软件检测中，保留分数从20.2%提升至38.6%，超过CL基线和新数据上的oracle上限；在二进制摘要中，BLEU分数约为先前工作中迁移学习的两倍，在跨表示泛化中超越所有基线。

Conclusion: RETROFIT在无历史数据的情况下有效缓解遗忘并保持适应性，为安全关键场景中的持续学习提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Motivation: 扩散模型生成高质量图像但推理成本高昂，需要大量去噪步骤和矩阵运算，需要在不影响质量的前提下提升推理效率。

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现Delta FID <= 10，模型压缩达6.25倍，时间步减少50%，推理加速2.8倍。

Conclusion: DiffPro将步长减少和精度规划统一为单个可部署计划，为实时节能扩散推理提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Conclusion: FairReweighing算法为回归任务提供了一种有效的公平性保障方法，特别适用于连续敏感属性的场景，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升公平性。

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为递归策略具有高偏差低方差，直接策略具有低偏差高方差。作者希望通过理论分解来重新审视这一观点，特别是在非线性模型的情况下。

Method: 将多步预测误差分解为不可约噪声、结构近似误差和估计方差三个部分。对于线性预测器，证明结构误差为零；对于非线性预测器，分析递归组合如何影响模型表达能力。还推导了递归策略的估计方差放大因子。

Result: 实验使用多层感知机在ETTm1数据集上验证了理论发现，表明递归预测可能同时具有更低的偏差和更高的方差。

Conclusion: 研究结果为选择递归和直接策略提供了实用指导，应基于模型非线性和噪声特性，而非传统的偏见-方差直觉。

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Conclusion: 这是使用Transformer进行时间序列信号处理的有趣示例，特别适用于边缘计算和物联网雷达，能够有效增强雷达数据集并减少计算需求。

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Motivation: 在分布式环境中运行MoE模型时，阻塞通信是主要效率瓶颈，需要解决计算与通信无法重叠的问题。

Method: 修改现代模型架构，通过跳过连接使模型能够重叠计算与通信，并对16B到109B参数规模的先进模型进行完全转换。

Result: 转换后的模型在准确性上与原始开源版本相当，例如Llama 4 Scout（109B）通过自蒸馏转换后，在下游评估中平均准确率仅下降1%。

Conclusion: FarSkip-Collective方法成功实现了大型模型架构修改，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Motivation: 现有的聚类方法在处理多个受保护属性（如年龄、种族、性别等）时往往无法为边缘化群体提供公平表示，这主要是由于训练数据中的偏见导致的。

Method: 将最近公平聚类问题推广到任意数量群体的场景，提出了近线性时间的近似算法来处理任意大小的多群体情况。

Conclusion: 本文的工作不仅解决了Chakraborty等人提出的开放性问题，还在公平相关聚类和公平共识聚类问题上取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Method: 将自注意力动力学建模为连续时间多智能体系统，分析其与多智能体Oja流的关系，并对单头自注意力系统的平衡点进行分类研究。

Result: 识别出四类平衡点：共识、二分共识、聚类和多边形平衡点，其中前三类通常共存且具有渐近稳定性。前两类平衡点始终与值矩阵的特征向量对齐，通常但不总是与主特征向量对齐。

Conclusion: 自注意力动力学表现出丰富的平衡点结构，这些平衡点与值矩阵的特征向量密切相关，为理解transformer注意力机制提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和硬件优化相结合，成功提升了MoBA的性能和效率，使其成为实用的长上下文处理方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Motivation: 研究AI系统在缺乏持续对齐工作的情况下如何自发偏离预定目标，为AI对齐问题提供定量理论基础。

Method: 定义了基于目标集合的伦理熵度量，推导了熵随时间增加的数学证明，建立了临界稳定性边界条件，并通过模拟实验验证理论。

Result: 70亿参数模型在无约束下熵从0.32增加到1.69±1.08纳特，而使用γ=20.4（1.5倍临界值）对齐工作的系统保持稳定在0.00±0.00纳特。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护先进自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了定量基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Motivation: 现实世界中的多目标决策问题需要从Pareto最优解集中选择最具代表性的子集，以减轻决策者的认知负担。现有质量度量存在一些不直观的行为，需要更好的度量方法。

Method: 将Pareto剪枝问题重新构建为多赢家投票问题，进行公理分析；引入新的directed coverage度量；分析不同质量度量的计算复杂性；进行实验评估。

Conclusion: 质量度量的选择对所选解集的特征有决定性影响，新提出的directed coverage度量在多个场景下表现良好，为多目标决策提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: 识别了自我评估、元推理和人类对齐推理控制等开放挑战，为未来自适应推理研究提供了系统指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法过于简化大脑连接性的复杂关系，假设单一模态的大脑连接组作为疾病传播基质，导致病理传播预测不准确。同时，纯数据驱动的方法由于缺乏适当约束而面临可识别性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合LLM的专家知识，能够更准确地学习疾病进展并构建具有更好可识别性的生物约束图结构，为神经退行性疾病进展建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束编程中，使用高级建模语言时，抽象结构需要转换为求解器支持的表示。对称性破坏是重要的加速技术，但应用于抽象变量会产生大量复杂约束，性能较差。

Method: 开发了一种新的不完全对称性破坏方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示来处理对称性，特别针对不可区分对象产生的对称性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示，有效解决了对称性破坏中的性能问题，在不可区分对象对称性处理上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Conclusion: MADC策略为LLM智能体扩展提供了关键改进路径，通过系统性模拟和优化多智能体辩论机制，显著提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Conclusion: DSS框架通过结合规划梯度和随机搜索，在自动驾驶规划任务中表现出优越性能，为安全可靠的自动驾驶提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

TL;DR: 本文提出了对比ABox解释的概念，用于回答"为什么a是C的实例而b不是"这类问题。与单独解释正蕴含或缺失蕴含的方法不同，对比解释同时考虑两者，关注a和b之间的相关共性和差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解释方法要么只解释为什么知识库蕴含C(a)，要么只解释为什么不蕴含C(b)，缺乏同时考虑两者的对比视角。对比解释能够更全面地揭示个体间的差异和共性。

Method: 为描述逻辑本体论中的ABox推理开发了对比解释的适当概念，分析了不同变体在不同最优性标准下的计算复杂度，考虑了轻量级和更表达性的描述逻辑。实现了一种计算对比解释变体的方法，并在现实知识库的生成问题上进行了评估。

Result: 研究分析了对比解释在不同描述逻辑和最优性标准下的计算复杂度，并实现了相应的计算方法。评估表明该方法在现实知识库问题上具有可行性。

Conclusion: 对比ABox解释提供了一种新的解释框架，能够同时考虑正蕴含和缺失蕴含，更有效地揭示个体间的差异。该方法在不同描述逻辑环境下具有不同的计算特性，为知识库推理提供了更丰富的解释能力。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一个可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合认知科学和机器学习，实现现实世界的社交导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Result: 识别了低延迟可靠性、带宽密集型数据共享和通信隐私权衡等核心挑战，并总结了现有方法在处理这些现实约束方面的进展。

Conclusion: 需要采用通信、学习和鲁棒性协同设计的统一方法，以解决理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距，并提出了未来研究的关键开放挑战和方向。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Method: 结合大型语言模型处理临床文本和文本化实验室检测，使用Transformer编码器处理纵向序列就诊数据，构建多模态融合模型CURENet。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和FEMH数据集上，CURENet在多标签框架下预测前10种慢性疾病的准确率超过94%。

Conclusion: 多模态EHR整合有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.
