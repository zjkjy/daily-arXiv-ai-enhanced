SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including\n2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across\nfour complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language\ndescriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables\nresearch on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,\nand automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports\nbroader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software\nmining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for\nscalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM\narchitectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level\nhuman semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent\nsystems that reason about code.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware\nresidual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as\ndynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual\ncondition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and\nspatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process\ntoward high-density reconstructions.

However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward\nhacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They\nachieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting\nspurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)\nthat correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than\ngenuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing\nthese issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking\nproblem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach\nto mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning.

We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format.

To\naddress these challenges, we have developed \\emph{TM-Rephrase}, a\nmodel-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\nrephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic\nmodeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we\ninvestigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and\ncolloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results\ndemonstrate that \\emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic\nmodeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic\ndiversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,\nwith the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains\nand especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.

Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during\nthe iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational\nburden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging\nvariant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ\nin decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping\npoint for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this\ndecision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake\nthoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as\nzero-step thinking.

As such Ultrasound\nImaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however\nthe sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate\nand private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as\nit is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive\nmedical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on\nnon-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can\nimpact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial\nfor accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to\ntackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to\nnon-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on\nenhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model\nwith attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%\naccuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour\nsegmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy.

In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT\nmethod that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory\nefficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,\nconnections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces\nbypass connections for these selected parameters.

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference.

In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations.

Traditional Granger causality tests\nbased on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal\nrelationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear\nGranger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these\nmethods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known\ninterventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent\nconfounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,\nreal-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,\nwithout prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is\ndifficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and\neven harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which\nleverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent\nconfounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with\nedge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In\naddition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions.

Moreover,\nreal-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,\nwithout prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is\ndifficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and\neven harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which\nleverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent\nconfounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with\nedge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In\naddition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the\ncompetitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

However, traditional evacuation simulation\nrelies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it\nchallenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design\nstages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building\nevacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation\nsimulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse\nfunctional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was\nestablished. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed\nphysical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a\ndiffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns\nfrom simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using\nConditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%\nimprovement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,\nthereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate\nthat the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design\niteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also\noffers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in\nintelligent building design.

It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

Existing approaches to high-dimensional\ninference for projection parameters, such as~\\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on\ninverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \\gtrsim\nd^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,\nrendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable\ndimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates\nwhen the number of iterations grows as $t \\gtrsim d^{1+\\delta}$ for any $\\delta\n> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works\nwhile improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based\nprocedure operates in $\\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\\mathcal{O}(d)$\nmemory, in contrast to the $\\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of\ncovariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we\nfurther develop an \\emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance\nappearing in the CLT and establish \\emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for\nthis estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and\ndata-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in\nthe near-optimal scaling regime $t \\gtrsim d^{1+\\delta}$."}

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.

This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is\ncharacterized by its unique \"intra-class clusters\" property, which presents two\nmajor challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.\nThese characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,\nsignificantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers\nfor highly imbalanced data.

This unprecedented volume of data\nintroduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms.

As a result, information that\nlarge language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by\nhumans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced\ninformation: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order\nto decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,\nthey too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of\nthe source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales\npitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have\nthis capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled\nexperiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent\nwith rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they\nsuccessfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.\nWe then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic\nreflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find\nthat LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as\nclosely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from\nvigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that\nboosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the\ncorrespondence between LLMs and the rational model.

These findings suggest two best practices\nfor addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the\nsize of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in\ntraining. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range\nof memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how\nreadily different types of private information are memorized. We also\ndemonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed\nfor membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to\nfurther explore, benchmark, and build upon our work."}
