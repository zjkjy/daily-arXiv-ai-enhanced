In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a \"universally effective\" GEO strategy.

These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.\n  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.\n  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA.

Despite widespread adoption, many established techniques suffer from notable limitations; some incur substantial computational cost, while others offer no definite statistical driven stopping criteria or assesses the significance of their importance scores. A common heuristic approach introduces multiple random noise features and retains all predictors ranked above the strongest noise feature. Although intuitive, this strategy lacks theoretical justification and depends heavily on heuristics. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method that addresses these limitations. Our approach introduces multiple random noise features and evaluates each feature's importance against the maximum importance value among these noise features incorporating a non-parametric bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework to establish a solid theoretical foundation. We establish the conceptual soundness of our approach through statistical derivations that articulate the principles guiding the design of our algorithm. To evaluate its reliability, we generated simulated datasets under controlled statistical settings and benchmarked performance against Boruta and Knockoff-based methods, observing consistently stronger recovery of meaningful signal. As a demonstration of practical utility, we applied the technique across diverse real-world datasets, where it surpassed feature selection techniques including Boruta, RFE, and Extra Trees. Hence, the method emerges as a robust algorithm for principled feature selection, enabling the distillation of informative predictors that support reliable inference, enhanced predictive performance, and efficient computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u53c2\u6570bootstrap\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6700\u5927\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u505c\u6b62\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6700\u5927\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u53c2\u6570bootstrap\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4Boruta\u548cKnockoff\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u6062\u590d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eBoruta\u3001RFE\u548cExtra Trees\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u53d6\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002"}}

Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark.

This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound.

This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08BLIP\u3001PaliGemma 2\u3001ViT-GPT2\uff09\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08COCO\u3001CC3M\u3001NoCaps\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728BLIP\u6a21\u578b\u548cCOCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u4f53VLM\u7684MIA\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e73\u5747ROC-AUC\u4e0b\u964d24%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff08MPNet\u548cROUGE-2\u6307\u6807\uff09\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u62b5\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u80fd\u5426\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u7ec4\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8f6c\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLM\u91cd\u7ec4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5f80\u5f80\u6765\u81ea\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6216\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u7ec4\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5355\u7ee7\u627f\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u6307\u5bfc\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u671f\u671b\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u91cd\u7ec4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53cc\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u7531\u8bf4\u660e\u3002"}}

Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation.

However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss.

We start with the discovery that the set of real-valued function $f$ that can be $\u03b5$-approximated with a binary circuit of size at most $c\u03b5^{-\u03b3}$ becomes convex in the `Harder than Monte Carlo' (HTMC) regime, when $\u03b3>2$, allowing for the definition of a HTMC norm on functions. In parallel one can define a complexity measure on the parameters of a ResNets (a weighted $\\ell_1$ norm of the parameters), which induce a `ResNet norm' on functions. The HTMC and ResNet norms can then be related by an almost matching sandwich bound. Thus minimizing this ResNet norm is equivalent to finding a circuit that fits the data with an almost minimal number of nodes (within a power of 2 of being optimal). ResNets thus appear as an alternative model for computation of real functions, better adapted to the HTMC regime and its convexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \\r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings.

To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations.

Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.\n  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Inferix\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u3001\u5177\u8eabAI\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u9501\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5LLM\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08\u5757\u6269\u6563\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u5757\u5185\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u524d\u9762\u5757\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165LLM\u98ce\u683c\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "Inferix\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "Inferix\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u793e\u533a\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u8fdb\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook.

Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements.

However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\\% and 19.3\\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aICPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5728\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709RLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u71b5\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faICPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u54cd\u5e94\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cICPO\u76f8\u6bd4GRPO\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ICPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u52bf\u5206\u6570\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u7c92\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u88ab\u4f4e\u4f30\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5f7b\u5e95\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

However, its formulation depends on expectations and divergences defined through high-dimensional integrals, often rendering analytical treatment impossible and necessitating heavy reliance on approximate learning and inference techniques. Possibility theory, an imprecise probability framework, allows to directly model epistemic uncertainty instead of leveraging subjective probabilities. While this framework provides robustness and interpretability under sparse or imprecise information, adapting VI to the possibilistic setting requires rethinking core concepts such as entropy and divergence, which presuppose additivity. In this work, we develop a principled formulation of possibilistic variational inference and apply it to a special class of exponential-family functions, highlighting parallels with their probabilistic counterparts and revealing the distinctive mathematical structures of possibility theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u65cf\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e38\u9700\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u3002\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u71b5\u548c\u6563\u5ea6\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u6570\u65cf\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6982\u7387\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u5e73\u884c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6570\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7ec4\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u6863\u901a\u5e38\u5197\u957f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a(i)\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u91cd\u7ec4\u6587\u6863\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b(ii)\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u719f\u6089\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\uff1b(iii)\u6a21\u62df\u6cd5\u9662\u5173\u4e8e\u4fee\u8f9e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5370\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5224\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7ec4\u6216\u89e3\u91ca\u5173\u952e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u4f4e\u63d0\u5347\u7ea61.5%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53474.36%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6cd5\u5f8b\u672f\u8bed\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u4eceNASA\u822a\u5929\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u5c55\u800c\u6765\uff0c\u73b0\u5df2\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u836f\u7269\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8\u533b\u7597\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u6cbb\u7597\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u9884\u9632\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u751f\u7269\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5df2\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5fc3\u810f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u6cbb\u7597\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u80bf\u7624\u5b66\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80bf\u7624\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f18\u5316\u653e\u7597\u3001\u836f\u7406\u5b66\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u52a0\u901f\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u6709\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u6574\u5408\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u7b49\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

When the number $K$ of communities remains smaller than $\\sqrt{n}$ --where $n$ denotes the number of nodes--, non-trivial community recovery is possible in polynomial time above, and only above, the Kesten--Stigum (KS) threshold, originally postulated using arguments from statistical physics.\n  When $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$, Chin, Mossel, Sohn, and Wein recently proved that, in the \\emph{sparse regime}, community recovery in polynomial time is achievable below the KS threshold by counting non-backtracking paths. This finding led them to postulate a new threshold for the many-communities regime $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$. Subsequently, Carpentier, Giraud, and Verzelen established the failure of low-degree polynomials below this new threshold across all density regimes, and demonstrated successful recovery above the threshold in certain moderately sparse settings. While these results provide strong evidence that, in the many community setting, the computational barrier lies at the threshold proposed in~Chin et al., the question of achieving recovery above this threshold still remains open in most density regimes.\n  The present work is a follow-up to~Carpentier et al., in which we prove Conjecture~1.4 stated therein by: \\\\ 1- Constructing a family of motifs satisfying specific structural properties; and\\\\ 2- Proving that community recovery is possible above the proposed threshold by counting such motifs.\\\\ Our results complete the picture of the computational barrier for community recovery in the SBM with $K \\geq \\sqrt{n}$ communities.

We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \\textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection.

Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing.

For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u9519\u8bef\u5207\u7247\uff09\uff0c\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5207\u7247\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282-10%\u7684\u5207\u7247\u6210\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u5207\u7247\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "CANVAS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b598\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fee\u6539\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728Figma\u6216Sketch\u7b49\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7f16\u8f91UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaCANVAS\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b598\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece3.3K\u79fb\u52a8UI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6db5\u76d630\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fee\u6539\u4e24\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "CANVAS\u57fa\u51c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dPPO\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff1a\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86ST-PPO\u548cS-PPO\u7b49\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "PPO\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5bb9\u6613\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u539f\u56e0\uff1a(1) \u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b(2) \u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2) \u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u5f62\u6210\u4e86Turn-PPO\u3001S-PPO\u548cST-PPO\u4e09\u4e2a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u7528QA\u3001\u591a\u8df3QA\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u9009\u9898\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-PPO\u548cS-PPO\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u9632\u6b62\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7PPO\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings.

This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668(TIE)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u50cftoken\u6570\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668(TIE)\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u751f\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u57281B\u548c3B\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e5d\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528TIE\u7684VLM\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53471.5\u548c1.3\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u5728DocVQA\u548cInfoVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u589e\u76ca\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u4e2a\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u534a\u56fe\u50cftokens\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TIE\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5173\u6ce8\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed.

It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.\n  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4ec5\u80fd\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38roll-out\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u662f\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u89c2\u6d4b\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u79cd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u80fd\u91c7\u6837\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38roll-out\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5728\u6700\u81ea\u7136\u7684Single-Reset\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Repeated-Reset\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u56fe\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7f6e\u8fd9\u4e00\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38roll-out\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ed4\u7ec6\u8003\u8651\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.\n  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.\n  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u677f\u9009\u62e9(DTS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u5197\u957f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u9ad84-8\u500d\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7b80\u5355MLP\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684RoBERTa\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u57281,000\u4e2aMMLU\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "MLP\u8def\u7531\u5668\u7684\u8def\u7531\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090.5%\uff0c\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8eRoBERTa\u768489.5%\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u5c111.25\u4ebf\u4e2a\u3002\u6a21\u677f\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e0a\u8def\u7531\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4fdd\u630190.5%\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u51cf\u5c1132.6%-33.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "DTS\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\uff0cMLP\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead.

Inspired by the success of FMs, particularly large language models, researchers have recently begun to explore spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) to improve adaptability and generalization across a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal (ST) tasks. Despite rapid progress, a systematic investigation of trajectory foundation models (TFMs), a crucial subclass of STFMs, is largely lacking. This tutorial addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances in TFMs, including a taxonomy of existing methodologies and a critical analysis of their strengths and limitations. In addition, the tutorial highlights open challenges and outlines promising research directions to advance spatio-temporal general intelligence through the development of robust, responsible, and transferable TFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TFMs\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u65f6\u7a7a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u4f18\u52a3\u52bf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65f6\u7a7a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08STFMs\uff09\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u7c7b\u2014\u2014\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TFMs\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u5173\u952e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4f18\u52a3\u52bf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u63a8\u8fdb\u65f6\u7a7a\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684TFMs\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u548c\u524d\u666f\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities.

While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths.

It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute \"delta\" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations.

While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790Ising\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4f2a\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08MPLE\uff09\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u5e7f\u4e49Ising\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u7b97\u5b50\u8303\u6570\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u6570Sobolev\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08MLSI\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u65e0\u7a77\u8303\u6570\uff08\u6709\u754c\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136Ising\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5df2\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e9\u9635\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4f2a\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08MPLE\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3001\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u754c\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u7c7b\u5e7f\u4e49Ising\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aIsing\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $\u0394$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $\u0394$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $\u0394$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\\%. $\u0394$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u0394-NeRF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfNeRF\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709NeRF\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u536b\u661f\u5730\u5f62\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u589e\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b8b\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5411\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u57fa\u7840NeRF\u6ce8\u5165\u9010\u5c42\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u0394-NeRF\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1130-42%\uff0cPSNR\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u534743.5%\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u0394-NeRF\u4e3aNeRF\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds.

While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller \u0394 across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks.

Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling.

Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation.

This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets.

Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter \u03c3. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \\citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\\% on the English test set and 50.7\\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\\% on English and 69.3\\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\\%.

Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "RefTr\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u7cbe\u70bc\u6c47\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6811\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9057\u6f0f\u5c0f\u5206\u652f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u81f4\u547d\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5b8c\u6574\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Producer-Refiner\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002Producer\u63d0\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u6c47\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cRefiner\u5faa\u73af\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f62\u6210\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6c47\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u6548\u6811\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u6781\u5927\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5408\u5e76\u91cd\u590d\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRefTr\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524dSOTA\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c112.4\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "RefTr\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57283D\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8840\u7ba1\u6811\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u8861\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Halpern-Pearl\u56e0\u679c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "Halpern-Pearl\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u6790\u53d6\u3001\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u5316Halpern-Pearl\u56e0\u679c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5141\u8bb8\u56de\u6eaf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u5b9a\u4e49\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u7406\u8bba\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods.

KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance.

A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval.

In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest.

Wallace", "Sen Wang"], "title": "Estimating Fog Parameters from a Sequence of Stereo Images", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog.

We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \\emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \\emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).", "AI": {"tldr": "V^2-SAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5c06SAM2\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u5272\u9002\u914d\u5230\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982ego-exo\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u5267\u70c8\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5982SAM2\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faV^2-SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u89d2\u951a\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668(V^2-Anchor)\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668(V^2-Visual)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5668(PCCS)\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ego-Exo4D\u3001DAVIS-2017\u548cHANDAL-X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "V^2-SAM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff1a\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6f14\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u504f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5206\u914d\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u6f14\u5316\u6743\u91cd\uff0c(2) \u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u8ba1\u7b97\u6743\u91cd\uff0c(3) \u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u7b49\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cAUC\uff09\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5b50\u7ec4\u5047\u9634\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u5728\u6700\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f14\u5316\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u66ff\u4ee3\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNull-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u5956\u52b1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6b20\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Null-TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u64cd\u7eb5\u6f5c\u5728\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "Null-TTA\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u5956\u52b1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u539f\u5219\u6027\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($\u0394t\\!=\\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$\u0394t$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $\u0394t$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($\u0394t = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u590d\u6742\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e94\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b15\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684SpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u800cMLLMs\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u8868\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cfMLLMs\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography (\"data\", \"poop\", \"loll\": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate).

Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \\pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \\pm 0.113 to 0.993 \\pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \\pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \\pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative.

With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks.

We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy.

Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW).

By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a \"Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia\" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($\u0394R_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($\u03ba= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale.

We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MortgageLLM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u4e13\u5bb6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8f68\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5982\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u91d1\u878d\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5355\u4e00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8f68\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u95ee\u7b54\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u6b8b\u5dee\u6280\u672f\u6062\u590d\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u540e\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578bMLM v2\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1aLLM-as-a-Judge\u6458\u8981\u5f97\u52064.58\uff08vs. 3.99\uff09\uff0c\u95ee\u7b54\u5f97\u52064.09\uff08vs. 4.0\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5f97\u52062.6\uff08vs. 1.2\uff09\u3002BERTScore\u5728\u6458\u8981\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u6b8b\u5dee\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u62b5\u62bc\u8d37\u6b3e\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u63a9\u7801\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a2\u7d22\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u6307\u5b9a\u4efb\u610f\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ec4\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper coins the term \"responsible computational foresight\", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures.

However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions.

However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model.

Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.\n  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.\n  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration.

In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy.

While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u4eba\u7c7b\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4e89\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728LLM\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u68c0\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u771f\u5b9e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u62ab\u9732\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5b50\u7fa4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5-\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4f7f\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u6539\u5584LLM\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4ecd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u5f52\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing.

However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions.

Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time.

To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance.

While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668(ViT)\u548c\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6(HE)\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5bc6CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u673a\u6784\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u7981\u6b62\u76f4\u63a5\u5171\u4eab\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u5efa\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u533b\u7597\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528CKKS\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u5bc6\u540e\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u5bc6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80ba\u764c\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4e09\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8054\u90a6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6781\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb(PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741)\uff0c\u800cCLS\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684HE\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9632\u6b62\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u672a\u52a0\u5bc6\u57df\u8fbe\u523096.12%\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u57df\u8fbe\u523090.02%\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u805a\u5408\u4ec5\u9700326KB\u52a0\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CLS\u4ee4\u724c\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u52a0\u5bc6\u51cf\u5c1130\u500d\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected \"thoughts\" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at \u03b1=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting \"thoughts\" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether \"training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences.\" We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c067B\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff080.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u6ce8\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0885%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6027\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Lindsey\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d88\u9664\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u975e\u7b49\u5f85\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u77ac\u65f6\u5355\u4ee4\u724c\u6ce8\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u662f\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6280\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u5411\u91cf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4ece0.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f385%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u96f6\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5355\u4ee4\u724c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\"\u60f3\u6cd5\"\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81f3\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u7f6eAI\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u6ee1\u8db3Lindsey\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \\textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency.

Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark.

Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration.

However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods.

However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods.

This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity.

To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition.

Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedAPA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWi-Fi\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fWi-Fi\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Wi-Fi CSI\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5f02\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedAPA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7b49\u539f\u578b\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u539f\u578b\u3002\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u672c\u5730\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b6\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6700\u591a20\u4eba\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fWi-Fi\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cFedAPA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u9ad89.65%\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad89%\uff0cMAE\u964d\u4f4e0.29\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c1195.94%\u3002", "conclusion": "FedAPA\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u805a\u5408\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Wi-Fi CSI\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7b80\u5355\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7537\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8986\u76d6\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u5316\u672f\u8bed\u4e0e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u97f3\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9ad8\u7b49\u58f0\u5b66\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f20\u8fbe\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u4ece\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5230\u8bed\u6cd5\u6027\u522b\u8bed\u8a00\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5224\u6027\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u505a\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\uff08\u82f1-\u897f/\u6cd5/\u610f\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b66\u8f93\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7537\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6027\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5c06\u6027\u522b\u5316\u672f\u8bed\u94fe\u63a5\u56de\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u9891\u7387\u8c31\u800c\u975e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u97f3\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u97f3\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u662f\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7537\u6027\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u672f\u8bed\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u4ee3\u8bcd\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbf\u95ee\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori.

Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus.

To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTemporal Diffusion Planner (TDP)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u738711-24.8\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5236\u5b9a\u77ed\u671f\u8be6\u7ec6\u3001\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u7cca\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "method": "TDP\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u9010\u6e10\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u66f4\u65b0\u524d\u4e00\u6b65\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u504f\u5dee\u8fc7\u5927\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6bcf\u6b65\u91cd\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTDP\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u534711-24.8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TDP\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context.

Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains.

Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization .

We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses \"minimum group confidence\" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u5fae\u8c03\uff08BFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5c42\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8868\u9762\u6307\u4ee4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5185\u5316\u788e\u7247\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "BFT\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u5728token\u7ea7\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u7f29\u653e\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u68af\u5ea6\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u4f7f\u7528'\u6700\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6'\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "BFT\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8ba9LLMs\u5b66\u5230\u4e86SFT\u9057\u6f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86GeneAgent\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u57fa\u56e0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "BFT\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules.

State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process.

Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression.

Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns.

Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset.

Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the \"user-item decoupling\" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques.

DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565ETE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u5757\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DLM\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u6162\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4ee4\u724c\u643a\u5e26\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u8f6e\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE)\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u5757\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u91cd\u5851\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u89e6\u53d1\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u660eETE\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8f6e\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4ee4\u724c\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0cETE\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DLM\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Empirical study of LLM-based verified program synthesis in Lean4 (code, specs, and proofs)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets.

Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes.

Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "EM-KD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5148\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u66fc\u54c8\u987f\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e08\u751f\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u84b8\u998f\uff08VLAD\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\uff08VSD\uff09\u3002VLAD\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4eb2\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1L1\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0cVSD\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bcd\u6c47\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cEM-KD\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\u3002\u4e0e\u914d\u5907\u76f8\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5148\u524d\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cEM-KD\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EM-KD\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548MLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \\textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks.

Entropy-Guided Adaptive Pruning for Diffusion and Flow Models", "comment": "Project page: https://github.com/changlin31/EntPruner", "summary": "Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance.

Project page: https://tele-ai.github.io/CtrlVDiff/", "summary": "We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.\n  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.\n  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions.

This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways.

This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., \"shape\", \"color\"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics.

However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability.

Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5e72\u6270\u9879\uff09\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u9006\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9006\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Idis\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u6570\u503c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d8\u5316\u5e72\u6270\u9879\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u9006\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u6dfb\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5c5e\u6027\u8ba1\u6570\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u9879\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u504f\u89c1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically.

Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MDLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5e72\u6270\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MDLMs\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARLMs\uff09\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aMDLMs\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790MDLMs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63a9\u7801\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0MDLMs\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u9644\u52a0\u5927\u91cf\u63a9\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0cMDLMs\u5bf9\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMDLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "GridAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f51\u683c\u5212\u5206\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u6307\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u6784\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982Best-of-N\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u6d88\u8017\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e14\u5149\u6805\u626b\u63cf\u89e3\u7801\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6574\u4e2a\u753b\u5e03\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "method": "GridAR\u91c7\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u5212\u5206\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u753b\u5e03\u4f4d\u7f6e\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u4fee\u526a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u884c\u5019\u9009\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\u6307\u5bfc\u540e\u7eed\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5e03\u5c40\u6307\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u6784\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u884c\u5e03\u5c40\u3002", "result": "\u5728N=4\u65f6\uff0cGridAR\u6bd4Best-of-N\uff08N=8\uff09\u5728T2I-CompBench++\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534714.4%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e25.6%\uff1b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPIE-Bench\u4e0a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u5ea6\u6bd4\u66f4\u5927N\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534713.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "GridAR\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Submitted to ESANN 2026", "summary": "Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting.

The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture.

Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters.

In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relev\u00e9s. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation.

However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences.

This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIELDS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54083D\u8868\u60c5\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u7559\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u611f\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u4eba\u8138\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91ce\u5916\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u4eba\u8138\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d562D\u76d1\u7763\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b32D/3D\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u76d1\u77632D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u81ea\u53d14D\u9762\u90e8\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u771f\u5b9e3D\u8868\u60c5\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u611f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91ce\u5916\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FIELDS\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u54082D/3D\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u8868\u60c5\u5f3a\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4fdd\u7559\u5fae\u5999\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability.

The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning.

Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data.

Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation.

While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices.

However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%.

Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility.

Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path.

While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems.

However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHTTM\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901fVGGT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5934\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b07\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "VGGT\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5934\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5408\u5e76(HTTM)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5934\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5408\u5e76token\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81token\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5408\u5e76\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPU\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe7\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "HTTM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u65483D token\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VGGT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConFu\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u5d4c\u5165\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u6210\u5bf9\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u89c6\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "ConFu\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9879\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6355\u83b7\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cConFu\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u548c\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e8c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "ConFu\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework.

Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates.

However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs.

While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiverseVAR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u548cscale-travel\u6f5c\u5728\u7ec6\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b(VAR)\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u4e5f\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5728\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fascale-travel\u6f5c\u5728\u7ec6\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7c97\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0escale-travel\u7ec6\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "DiverseVAR\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VAR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes.

While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-M3RF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b49\u53d8\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u91cd\u7ec4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SE(3)\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u788e\u7247\u91cd\u7ec4\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76843D\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9632\u6b62\u91cd\u53e0\u7ec4\u88c5\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTransformer\u63d0\u53d6\u989c\u8272\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SE(3)\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u6362\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728RePAIR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e23.1%\uff0c\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e13.2%\uff0cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c1118.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u548c\u7b49\u53d8\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53473D\u91cd\u7ec4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms.

Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage.

Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods.

Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility.

This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis.

However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Process Reward Feedback Learning (PRFL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3a\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f93\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06ReFL\u4f18\u5316\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684VAE\u89e3\u7801\u540e\u7684\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65e9\u671f\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPRFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u94fe\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u65e0\u9700VAE\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePRFL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4RGB ReFL\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "PRFL\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5956\u52b1\u53cd\u9988\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints.

To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data.

Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Harmony\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u5f3aCFG\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u540c\u6b65\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5bf9\u5e94\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f20\u7edfCFG\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHarmony\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ea4\u53c9\u4efb\u52a1\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u97f3\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b2\uff09\u5168\u5c40-\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u98ce\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3\uff09\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u5f3aCFG\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u653e\u5927\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eHarmony\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Harmony\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5236\u5316\u5f3a\u5236\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a16\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u53e3\u8154\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u53e3\u8154\u764c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8683.33%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53e3\u8154\u764c\u5728\u5168\u7403\u975e\u5e38\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u53e3\u8154\u5185\u826f\u6027\u3001\u764c\u524d\u75c5\u53d8\u548c\u6076\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u665a\u671f\u624d\u88ab\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u5b9e\u65bd\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u671b\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8683.33%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300189.12%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u548c77.31%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u53e3\u8154\u764c\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}
