However, the research and\ndevelopment of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail\nto capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that\nlead to ambiguous conclusions. This paper introduces the Open Recommendation\nBenchmark for Reproducible Research with HIdden Tests (ORBIT), a unified\nbenchmark for consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models.\nORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with\nreproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.\nAdditionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,\nfeaturing web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.\nClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and\nprivacy-guaranteed browsing data. It aligns with modern recommendation\nscenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to\nchallenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12\nrepresentative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a\nprompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results\nreflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,\nwith variable individual performances.

In this paper, we propose OneTrans,\na unified Transformer backbone that simultaneously performs user-behavior\nsequence modeling and feature interaction. OneTrans employs a unified tokenizer\nto convert both sequential and non-sequential attributes into a single token\nsequence. The stacked OneTrans blocks share parameters across similar\nsequential tokens while assigning token-specific parameters to non-sequential\ntokens. Through causal attention and cross-request KV caching, OneTrans enables\nprecomputation and caching of intermediate representations, significantly\nreducing computational costs during both training and inference.

Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual\nKeys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned\nduring language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive\nsystematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to\ntheir under-utilization in the context representation.

To address this, we\nintroduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a\nzero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities\nin natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and\ninference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the\nLLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric\nmethod that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of\nsolutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and\nexam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are\nparametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),\nwhile LISTEN-T offers more robust performance.

In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al.

In this paper, we demonstrate why\nInfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a\nsimple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI\nestimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling\nconsistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with\nsignificantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using\nproper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the\nlog score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive\nobjectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single\nprincipled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log\nscore achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve\nthe downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive\nrepresentation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but\nfrom the learning of structured density ratios."}

Our study\nchallenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find\nthat combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the\nin-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a\nsufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we\nobserve that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language\nthat serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits\nacross language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot\nlanguage from within a specific family does not consistently improve\nperformance for languages within that family.

We used XGBoost models on data\nfrom 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance\nwith R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold\ncross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the\nembedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13\nof 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three\nembedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average\n5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),\nnew HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,\n0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with\nlow primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results\ndemonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for\nselect health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the\nintegration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for\nsupplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems."}

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

Evidence from Neuron Agreement", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via\nsample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground\ntruth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external\noutputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these\nsignals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze\ninternal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)\nexternal signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;\n(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than\nincorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct\nresponses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones\ndiverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding\n(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using\nactivation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on\ninternal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables\nearly correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports\naggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable\nanswers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where\nmajority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64.

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing.

HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed\nto satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual\nrealism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right."}

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched.

[2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer\nlanguage models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of\nrelations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific."}

To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al.

In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles.

Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger."}

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully\ndynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and\ntopology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as\nscientific model discovery and robust representation learning."}

Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts.

This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation.

The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions.

We identify and formally\ncharacterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform\nand context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,\nerasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement\nprocess, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in\nuniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token\nordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and\nsemantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are\nfrozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This\ntimestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an\nadaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of\nrefinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies\nuniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision\nsources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment\ncontrol, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves\nperplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers\nmaximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).\nTogether, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep\nallocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving\nstable and controllable diffusion text generation."}

[2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer\nlanguage models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of\nrelations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such\ncollections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3\ntensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this\nsurprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we\napply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our\nresults reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but\nextract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital\ncity and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This\nproperty-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and\nhighlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically\nclose. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer\nlanguage models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific."}

There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem.

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's.
