To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning.

To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we\nconducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant\nusing a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical\nmodel architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed\napproach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved\nnear-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared\nto a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also\nsignificantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality\npredictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample\nsize."}

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

We further assessed (1) the stability of synthetic PHI\ngeneration using a \"hide-in-plain-sight\" method and (2) performance against\ncommercial systems. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were computed across all\nPHI categories. Results: Our model achieved overall F1 scores of 0.973 on the\nPenn dataset and 0.996 on the Stanford dataset, outperforming or maintaining\nthe previous state-of-the-art model performance. Synthetic PHI evaluation\nshowed consistent detectability (overall F1: 0.959 [0.958-0.960]) across 50\nindependently de-identified Penn datasets. Our model outperformed all vendor\nsystems on synthetic Penn reports (overall F1: 0.960 vs. 0.632-0.754).\nDiscussion: Large-scale, multimodal training improved cross-institutional\ngeneralization and robustness. Synthetic PHI generation preserved data utility\nwhile ensuring privacy. Conclusion: A transformer-based de-identification model\ntrained on diverse radiology datasets outperforms prior academic and commercial\nsystems in PHI detection and establishes a new benchmark for secure clinical\ntext processing."}

This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation.

However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone\nis an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV\ncaptures the intended concept. In fact, we argue that probes are more likely to\ncapture spurious correlations than they are to represent only the intended\nconcept. As part of our analysis, we demonstrate that deliberately misaligned\nprobes constructed to exploit spurious correlations, achieve an accuracy close\nto that of standard probes. To address this severe problem, we introduce a\nnovel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and\nprovide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization\ntechniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment.

Several LLMs (including GPT-4.1, Claude 4\nSonnet and Bielik-11B-v2.6) were tested in closed-book and various\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation settings. The results show that although the\nmodels achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing\nthreshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the\n'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining\ncommittee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to\nhallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical\nargumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and\ntechnical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological\nprogress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners\nin Polish public procurement adjudication."}

Instead of treating ambiguity as a deficiency, we reframe it as a\nfeature of cooperative interaction, where the responsibility of query\nspecification is shared among the user and the system. We develop a principled\nframework distinguishing cooperative queries, i.e., queries that yield a\nresolvable interpretation, from uncooperative queries that cannot be resolved.\nApplying the framework to evaluations for tabular question answering and\nanalysis, we analyze the queries in 15 popular datasets, and observe an\nuncontrolled mixing of query types neither adequate for evaluating a system's\nexecution accuracy nor for evaluating interpretation capabilities. Our\nframework and analysis of queries shifts the perspective from fixing ambiguity\nto embracing cooperation in resolving queries.

After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories.

By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can\nimplicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that\nbetter match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful\ncapabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader\nrange of T2V tasks.

KoTaP is designed\nto treat corporate tax avoidance as a predictor variable and link it to\nmultiple domains, including earnings management (accrual- and activity-based),\nprofitability (ROA, ROE, CFO, LOSS), stability (LEV, CUR, SIZE, PPE, AGE,\nINVREC), growth (GRW, MB, TQ), and governance (BIG4, FORN, OWN). Tax avoidance\nitself is measured using complementary indicators cash effective tax rate\n(CETR), GAAP effective tax rate (GETR), and book-tax difference measures (TSTA,\nTSDA) with adjustments to ensure interpretability. A key strength of KoTaP is\nits balanced panel structure with standardized variables and its consistency\nwith international literature on the distribution and correlation of core\nindicators. At the same time, it reflects distinctive institutional features of\nKorean firms, such as concentrated ownership, high foreign shareholding, and\nelevated liquidity ratios, providing both international comparability and\ncontextual uniqueness. KoTaP enables applications in benchmarking econometric\nand deep learning models, external validity checks, and explainable AI\nanalyses. It further supports policy evaluation, audit planning, and investment\nanalysis, making it a critical open resource for accounting, finance, and\ninterdisciplinary research."}

At the same\ntime, there are well-documented imbalances in the training data and\noptimisation objectives of this technology, raising doubts as to whether LLMs\ncan represent the cultural diversity of their broad user base. In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt. These findings reveal that LLMs occupy an uncomfortable middle\nground: They are responsive enough to changes in prompts to produce variation,\nbut too firmly anchored to specific cultural defaults to adequately represent\ncultural diversity."}

For example, we demonstrated one\nexperiment where we are able to truncate $60\\%$ and $80\\%$ of the parameters of\na ViT-Tiny model with $~1.3\\%$ and $~4\\%$ accuracy drop in CIFAR-10 performance\nrespectively. The efficacy of Q3R is confirmed on Transformers across both\nimage and language tasks, including for low-rank fine-tuning."}

To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O.

Here we ask whether such interventions create\nout-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises\nconcerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target\nmodel in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common\ncausal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away\nfrom the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences\nthat occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within\nbehavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate\nhidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes. Finally, in an\neffort to mitigate the pernicious cases, we modify the Counterfactual Latent\n(CL) loss from Grant (2025) that regularizes interventions to remain closer to\nthe natural distributions, reducing the likelihood of harmful divergences while\npreserving the interpretive power of interventions.

To this end,\nwe develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system\nthat mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given\nthe baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,\nformulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous\nexperimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous\napproaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI\nScientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding\nagents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically\nvaluable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments\nusing AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,\na venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings\ndemonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review\nscores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify\nimportant limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science\nreviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI\nScientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we\ncomprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope\nthese insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI\nScientist development."}

WELL: Dynamic Reasoning and Learning with Symbolic World Model for Embodied LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration", "comment": null, "summary": "Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with\npartial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}
