While Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),\nsingle-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic\ncomplexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent\nframework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into\nspatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,\nincluding a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic\nenrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent\npipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity\nextraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a\nreview agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the\ngenerated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system\nusing both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive\nSpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and\nthree levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall\naccuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review\nand corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy\nof 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review\nagent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system\ngenerates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than\nthose in the benchmarks.

Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning\nefficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration\nhints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we\npropose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an\nautomated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes\nand providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a\ngeneral prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)\ndescriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined\nand optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may\nbe partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,\nEGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two\nsteps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG\nfor each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the\nguidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm\nfurther refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual\ngradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public\nhealth, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves\n7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to\nreach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It\nalso outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability."}

While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic\nanswers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications\nrequiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,\ncontent diversification, and multiplayer games.

Consequently, it\nleads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting\nthe task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and\nunderperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new\ncollaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum\ngame.

While the sample complexity of online\nSGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent\nworks improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample\nwith different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --\nand instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.\nHowever, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently\nlarge. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)\nand sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that\nencapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates.

However, existing vision encoders\nfocus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional\nanalysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of\nfine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training\nparadigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that\nintegrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first\nconstruct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired\nwith over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large\nscale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a\npretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to\ntrain fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the\nfine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption\nregression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in\nthe pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision\nfeature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further\nincorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization\nconstraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning\ncapability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision\nencoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it\nachieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,\nand OCR understanding."}

Yet its suitability\nfor precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic\nstudy of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive\nrate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and\nhallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\nusing standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a\nclear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall\naccuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical\nuse. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these\nprecision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are\nacceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms\nself-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a\nsimple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken\ntogether, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial\nfor average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict\nprecision."}

Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both\npositive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard\ncomplexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in\nstark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating\nexplanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input\nspace; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the\ntypes of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only\nemerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity\ndistinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus\nclassification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural\nnetworks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to\nexplain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain\nexplanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light\non the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a\nrigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations\nare possible or provably hard."}

We provide\ntheoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from\nboth statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs\ncan improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near\nthe teacher's decision boundary.
