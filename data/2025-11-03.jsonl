However, most existing methods adopt a single-step\ngeneration process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with\nminimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,\nwhich progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes\nthe scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical\ngenerative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.\nHiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic\nobjects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model\ncompletes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent\ngeneration, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph\n(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic\ndependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and\ngeometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a\none-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting\nrecursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms\nsingle-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user\npreference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D\nscene construction."}

This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these\nchallenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating\nlong (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations,\naccompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities.\nFrom this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and\n2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose\nLIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three\ncomplementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working\nmemory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on\nBEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without\nretrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen.

Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational\ncost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive\nvisual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel\nmulti-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our\ndesign, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional\ninformation to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention\n(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce\ncomputational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient\nlightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT\nserves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes\nto democratization of generative AI models."}

The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process\nenriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to\nundetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison\nand quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark\nfor hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of\nhigh-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and\nreliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations."}

While the discovery of decodable neural\nrepresentations for distinct concepts in Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsuggested a modular architecture, whether these representations are truly\nindependent systems remains an open question. Here we provide evidence for a\nconvergent architecture. Across a range of LLMs, we find that diverse\nevaluative judgments are computed along a dominant dimension, which we term the\nValence-Assent Axis (VAA). This axis jointly encodes subjective valence (\"what\nis good\") and the model's assent to factual claims (\"what is true\"). Through\ndirect interventions, we show this unified representation creates a critical\ndependency: the VAA functions as a control signal that steers the generative\nprocess to construct a rationale consistent with its evaluative state, even at\nthe cost of factual accuracy. This mechanism, which we term the subordination\nof reasoning, shifts the process of reasoning from impartial inference toward\ngoal-directed justification.

Our\napproach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship\nbetween previously learned knowledge and new information across different\ntraining stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.\nSpecifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our\nmethod mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual\npretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature\ndistillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge\ndistillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of\nthe model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations.

The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which\noften collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on\ndomain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that\nintegrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering.\nInstead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to\nintervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing\nprior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it\npossible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable\ntrajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter\nout sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these\ncomponents enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon\nenvironments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using\nInnovatorBench.

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We\nexplore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a\nmodel to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal\nactivations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we\nintroduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant\ncues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as\ntraining data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as\ndegrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While\nBCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak\nreduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing\nreliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better\nviewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues."}

This paper\nintroduces \\textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously\nenhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing\napproach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer\nresponses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult\nproblems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that\ndynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on\nthe model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient\nreasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory\nthought chains for ``Hard'' problems.

These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via\nresampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model\nreasoning, and principled CoT interventions."}

We introduce\nSpatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals\ndirectly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically\nformulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:\nshuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,\nregional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks\nprovide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or\nLVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning\nwhile preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding\nbenchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average\naccuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines.

However, finding appropriate\ncounterfactual cases is an open challenge, as is interpreting which features\nare most critical for the change in outcome. Here, we pose the question of\ncounterfactual search and interpretation in terms of similarity learning,\nexploiting the representation learned by the random forest predictive model\nitself. Once a counterfactual is found, the feature importance of the\nexplanation is computed as a function of which random forest partitions are\ncrossed in order to reach it from the original instance.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP).
