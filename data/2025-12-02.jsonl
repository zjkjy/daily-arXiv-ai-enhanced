These strengths present new opportunities to enhance traditional recommendation systems (RS), especially in the cold-start item scenario where newly introduced items lack interactions. Existing works have used LLMs to address cold-start issues in traditional RS through data augmentation, but they have limitations. One recent work directly addresses this issue by prompting LLMs to generate augmented interaction data between randomly sampled users and cold-start items. Then, they train the traditional RS with augmented data, incorporating collaborative signals for cold-start items. Although they use LLMs to provide cold-start items with feedback, they use partial user histories, which does not allow the LLM to fully emulate the user. Furthermore, randomly selecting users is not optimal for augmentation. To address these challenges, we leverage the LLM as a user and develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains a policy to select users for augmentation, optimizing for cold-start item performance after augmented training. The policy model learns to select users for cold-start item data augmentation based on their behavioral features and histories. To optimize user selection for cold-start item performance, we employ a policy gradient method that updates the policy in the direction of actions that lead to high rewards. Experiments on Amazon Product Review datasets show substantial gains in cold-start item recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method as a scalable, serving-efficient augmentation strategy for modern RS."}

In this work, we address IGROT under low-data supervision by introducing UNION, a lightweight and generalisable target representation that fuses the image embedding with a null-text prompt. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fixed target features, UNION enhances semantic alignment with multimodal queries while requiring no architectural modifications to pretrained vision-language models.

Unlike prevailing l1 regularized approaches that approximate a sparsifying penalty, we formulate the problem by imposing an explicit cardinality constraint on the kernel weights and add an l2 penalty for robustness. We solve the resulting non-convex minimax problem via an alternating best response algorithm with two subproblems: the alpha subproblem is a standard kernel SVM dual solved via LIBSVM, while the beta subproblem admits an efficient solution via the Greedy Selector and Simplex Projector algorithm. We reformulate SMKL as a mixed integer semidefinite optimization problem and derive a hierarchy of semidefinite convex relaxations which can be used to certify near-optimality of the solutions returned by our best response algorithm and also to warm start it. On ten UCI benchmarks, our method with random initialization outperforms state-of-the-art MKL approaches in out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 3.34 percentage points (relative to the best performing benchmark) while selecting a small number of candidate kernels in comparable runtime. With warm starting, our method outperforms the best performing benchmark's out-of-sample prediction accuracy on average by 4.05 percentage points. Our convex relaxations provide a certificate that in several cases, the solution returned by our best response algorithm is the globally optimal solution."}

The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation (\"boxes\"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a \"consistent group\", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem."}

Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics."}

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.\n  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine data-driven learning with physics-based constraints to ensure the model's predictions are with underlying physical principles.However, PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for edge computing and real-time processing. However, naively converting PINNs to SNNs degrades physical fidelity and fails to address long-term generalization issues. To this end, this paper introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Importantly, to ensure strict physical conservation, we design the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, whose dynamics structurally guarantee local mass preservation. To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction. Extensive experiments show that our PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks. For both the canonical 1D heat equation and the more challenging 2D Laplace's Equation, it accurately simulates the system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design -- a feat that is challenging for conventional PINNs.

Existing MERC approaches predominantly focus on cross-modal shared features, often overlooking modality-specific features that capture subtle yet critical emotional cues such as micro-expressions, prosodic variations, and sarcasm. Although related work in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has explored disentangling shared and modality-specific features, these methods typically employ rigid orthogonal constraints to achieve full disentanglement, which neglects the inherent complementarity between feature types and may limit recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose Angle-Optimized Feature Learning (AO-FL), a framework tailored for MERC that achieves partial disentanglement of shared and specific features within each modality through adaptive angular optimization. Specifically, AO-FL aligns shared features across modalities to ensure semantic consistency, and within each modality it adaptively models the angular relationship between its shared and modality-specific features to preserve both distinctiveness and complementarity. An orthogonal projection refinement further removes redundancy in specific features and enriches shared features with contextual information, yielding more discriminative multimodal representations. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AO-FL for MERC, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, AO-FL can be seamlessly integrated with various unimodal feature extractors and extended to other multimodal fusion tasks, such as MER, thereby highlighting its strong generalization beyond MERC."}

However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation.

Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment (OD-PFA), a novel framework designed explicitly to capture both shared semantics and modality-specific emotional cues. Our approach first decouples unimodal features into shared and modality-specific components. An orthogonal disentanglement strategy (OD) enforces effective separation between these components, aided by a reconstruction loss to maintain critical emotional information from each modality. Additionally, a projected feature alignment strategy (PFA) maps shared features across modalities into a common latent space and applies a cross-modal consistency alignment loss to enhance semantic coherence.

Mean-variance regression models, which predict both a mean and residual noise for each data point, provide a simple approach to uncertainty quantification. However, overparameterized mean-variance models struggle with signal-to-noise ambiguity, deciding whether prediction targets should be attributed to signal (mean) or noise (variance). At one extreme, models fit all training targets perfectly with zero residual noise, while at the other, they provide constant, uninformative predictions and explain the targets as noise. We observe a sharp phase transition between these extremes, driven by model regularization. Empirical studies with varying regularization levels illustrate this transition, revealing substantial variability across repeated runs. To explain this behavior, we develop a statistical field theory framework, which captures the observed phase transition in alignment with experimental results. This analysis reduces the regularization hyperparameter search space from two dimensions to one, significantly lowering computational costs.

While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed \"PathReasoning\", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy.

We further automate assessment through an MLLM-as-Jury framework that approximates human judgment. Human evaluations show that models generate more coherent, visually appealing, and culturally appropriate stories for real-world datasets than for animated ones. The generated stories exhibit a stronger alignment with English-speaking cultures across all metrics except Cohesion, where Chinese performs better. In contrast, Hindi ranks lowest on all metrics except Visual Aesthetics, reflecting real-world cultural biases embedded in current models. This multicultural analysis provides a foundation for future research aimed at generating culturally appropriate and inclusive visual stories across diverse linguistic and cultural settings."}

In this paper, we focus on user-level FedRecs, which is a more practical yet challenging setting compared to group-level FedRecs. Adversarial training emerges as the most feasible approach within this context. We identify two key challenges in implementing adversarial training-based attribute unlearning for user-level FedRecs: i) mitigating training instability caused by user data heterogeneity, and ii) preventing attribute information leakage through gradients. To address these challenges, we propose FedAU2, an attribute unlearning method for user-level FedRecs.

Based on this loss function, we develop a corresponding SVM model called RHPSVM (Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss Support Vector Machine). Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility.

Powered by Large Language and Vision-Language Models, IoA enables the development of interactive, rational agents capable of complex cooperation, moving far beyond traditional isolated models. IoA involves physical entities, i.e., Wireless Agents (WAs) with limited onboard resources, which need to offload their compute-intensive agentic AI services to nearby servers. Such servers can be Mobile Agents (MAs), e.g., vehicle agents, or Fixed Agents (FAs), e.g., end-side units agents. Given their fixed geographical locations and stable connectivity, FAs can serve as reliable communication gateways and task aggregation points. This stability allows them to effectively coordinate with and offload to an Aerial Agent (AA) tier, which has an advantage not affordable for highly mobile MAs with dynamic connectivity limitations. As such, we propose a two-tier optimization approach. The first tier employs a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. In the game, MAs and FAs act as the leaders who set resource prices. WAs are the followers to determine task offloading ratios. However, when FAs become overloaded, they can further offload tasks to available aerial resources. Therefore, the second tier introduces a Double Dutch Auction model where overloaded FAs act as the buyers to request resources, and AAs serve as the sellers for resource provision.

In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate. Rashomon sets are also stable under small distribution shifts.

Then we explore the alignment and the recommender systems ranking agreement between the LLM-judge and human provided relevance labels. We find that incorporating richer item metadata and longer user histories improves alignment, and that LLM-judge yields high agreement with human-based rankings (Kendall's tau = 0.87). Finally, an industrial case study in the podcast recommendation domain demonstrates the practical value of LLM-judge for model selection. Overall, our results show that LLM-judge is a viable and scalable approach for evaluating recommender systems."}

However, the training datasets may be crowdsourced and include sensitive information, such as personal contact details, financial data, and medical records. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on developing privacy-preserving training algorithms for neural networks that maintain good performance while preserving privacy. In this paper, we investigate the generalization and privacy performances of the differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) algorithm, which is a private variant of the gradient descent (GD) by incorporating additional noise into the gradients during each iteration. Moreover, we identify a concrete learning task where DP-GD can achieve superior generalization performance compared to GD in training two-layer Huberized ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, a small signal-to-noise ratio can result in GD producing training models with poor test accuracy, whereas DP-GD can yield training models with good test accuracy and privacy guarantees if the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small. This indicates that DP-GD has the potential to enhance model performance while ensuring privacy protection in certain learning tasks. Numerical simulations are further conducted to support our theoretical results."}

This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions."}

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged."}

Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start.

However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability. Experiments across multiple MCQ benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches reduce bias, increasing consistency in accuracy while minimizing computational costs."}

Jeff Hong"], "title": "UCB for Large-Scale Pure Exploration: Beyond Sub-Gaussianity", "comment": null, "summary": "Selecting the best alternative from a finite set represents a broad class of pure exploration problems. Traditional approaches to pure exploration have predominantly relied on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the performance distributions of all alternatives, which limit their applicability to non-sub-Gaussian especially heavy-tailed problems. The need to move beyond sub-Gaussianity may become even more critical in large-scale problems, which tend to be especially sensitive to distributional specifications. In this paper, motivated by the widespread use of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms in pure exploration and beyond, we investigate their performance in the large-scale, non-sub-Gaussian settings. We consider the simplest category of UCB algorithms, where the UCB value for each alternative is defined as the sample mean plus an exploration bonus that depends only on its own sample size. We abstract this into a meta-UCB algorithm and propose letting it select the alternative with the largest sample size as the best upon stopping. For this meta-UCB algorithm, we first derive a distribution-free lower bound on the probability of correct selection. Building on this bound, we analyze two general non-sub-Gaussian scenarios: (1) all alternatives follow a common location-scale structure and have bounded variance; and (2) when such a structure does not hold, each alternative has a bounded absolute moment of order $q > 3$. In both settings, we show that the meta-UCB algorithm and therefore a broad class of UCB algorithms can achieve the sample optimality. These results demonstrate the applicability of UCB algorithms for solving large-scale pure exploration problems with non-sub-Gaussian distributions. Numerical experiments support our results and provide additional insights into the comparative behaviors of UCB algorithms within and beyond our meta-UCB framework."}

A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language. With these findings, we aim to assist the scientific community in utilizing existing wav2vec2-based pre-trained models, as well as facilitate the pre-training of new ones."}

The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts.

To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing.

We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback.

This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning."}

Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets.

Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings."}

However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

Existing approaches either rely on elaborate prompt engineering, whose effectiveness is heavily dependent on human experience, or integrate policy networks and pre-trained policy models, which are usually difficult to adapt to new dialogue scenarios and costly to train. Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM. The proposed approach further demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks."}

Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale.

Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment."}

We first establish the asymptotic normality of the QRF estimator by handling the non-differentiable pinball loss via Knight's identity. Second, we uncover a \"phase transition\" phenomenon governed by the subsampling rate $β$ (where $s \\asymp n^β$). We prove that in the bias-dominated regime ($β\\ge 1/2$), which corresponds to large subsample sizes typically favored in practice to maximize predictive accuracy, standard inference breaks down as the estimator converges to a deterministic bias constant rather than a zero-mean normal distribution. Finally, we derive the explicit analytic form of this asymptotic bias and discuss the theoretical feasibility of restoring valid inference via analytic bias correction. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between predictive performance and inferential validity, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the intrinsic limitations of random forest inference in high-dimensional settings."}

However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents."}

We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models."}

The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains.

In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients. We further show that the variance-optimal baseline is a gradient-weighted estimator, offering a new principle for variance reduction and naturally enhancing stability beyond existing methods.

A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states."}

However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability.

Unlike conventional VAEs that jointly optimize reconstruction and clustering (often leading to training instability), our method utilizes a block-coordinate descent strategy, alternating between expectation and maximization steps. This approach stabilizes training and naturally aligns latent clusters with distinct physical regimes. To objectively evaluate the learned representations, we introduce a quantitative metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness, which measures the coherence of physical quantities across the latent manifold. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on datasets of increasing complexity: surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images.

Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement."}

LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%."}

Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset.

In multimodal machine learning, choosing the strategy for fusing data together requires careful consideration of the application's accuracy and latency requirements, as fusing the data at earlier or later stages in the model architecture can lead to performance changes in accuracy and latency. To demonstrate this tradeoff, we investigate different fusion strategies using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework that integrates image and text data. We explore two different vision networks: MobileNetV2 and ViT. We propose three models for each vision network, which fuse data at late, intermediate, and early stages in the architecture. We evaluate the proposed models on the CMU MOSI dataset and benchmark their latency on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. Our experimental results demonstrate that while late fusion yields the highest accuracy, early fusion offers the lowest inference latency. We describe the three proposed model architectures and discuss the accuracy and latency tradeoffs, concluding that data fusion earlier in the model architecture results in faster inference times at the cost of accuracy."}

When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand.

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.\n  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity."}

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%).

In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones."}

To further enhance our proposed defense mechanism, we adopt a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation scheme over the outcomes of the generated samples.

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments."}

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design.

We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task.

Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling."}

A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins.

In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods."}

This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes."}

Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex.

In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification."}

While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems."}

Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade.

However, such efforts often overlook attacks that exploit the model's capacity for abstract generalization, creating a critical blind spot in current alignment strategies. This gap enables adversaries to induce objectionable content by subtly manipulating the implicit social values embedded in model outputs. In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B. Experimental results show that MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in commercial LLMs: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment."}

However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings."}

Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost.

Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance.

Each concept was annotated with standard biomedical vocabularies, including the UMLS, OMOP Standardized Vocabularies, DrugBank, NDC, and NLM VSAC value sets. To balance coverage and manageability, we applied the Jenks Natural Breaks method to identify an optimal set of representative concepts.\n  Results\n  The optimized AD-CDO achieved over 63% coverage of extracted trial concepts while maintaining interpretability and compactness.

In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning."}

Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of our model."}

In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they cannot simultaneously fit two lengths with different residues modulo $p$.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute."}

For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent."}

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications.

In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans."}

AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks.

Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions.

To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets."}

Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art."}

Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans.

First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

Using ablation studies on 50 queries (15 answerable, 10 edge cases, and 25 adversarial), we show that enhancements such as hybrid retrieval, ensemble verification, and adaptive thresholding provide almost no benefit when used in isolation, yet together achieve a 95% reduction in abstention (from 40% to 2%) without increasing hallucinations. We also identify a measurement challenge: different verification strategies can behave safely but assign inconsistent labels (for example, \"abstained\" versus \"unsupported\"), creating apparent hallucination rates that are actually artifacts of labeling. Our results show that synergistic integration matters more than the strength of any single component, that standardized metrics and labels are essential for correctly interpreting performance, and that adaptive calibration is needed to prevent overconfident over-answering even when retrieval quality is high."}

However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance. Our research provides a roadmap for advancing click-through rate predictions and extending their value beyond e-commerce."}

This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed.

We present the first benchmark that isolates procedural memory retrieval from task execution, evaluating whether agents can recognize functionally equivalent procedures that span different object instantiations. Using ALFWorld, we construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods using systematically stratified queries. Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders.

Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent.

In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis. We also advance a unifying framework that explains the pervasive quantum organization of meaning that we identify."}

To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders."}

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety."}

The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning.

Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception."}

Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis."}

RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning.

Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction."}

The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner"}

However, the inherent variability of EEG signals due to psychological and physical factors necessitates a cumbersome calibration process. In particular, the inter-subject variability of EEG signals leads to a domain shift problem, which makes it challenging to generalize drowsiness detection models to unseen target subjects. To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time. In addition, we introduce prototype learning to ensure robust predictions against distribution shifts over time. We validated our method on the sustained-attention driving dataset collected in a simulated environment, where drowsiness was estimated from delayed reaction times during monotonous lane-keeping tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines, achieving an average F1-score of 81.73\\%, an improvement of 11.73\\% over the best TTA baseline. This demonstrates that our proposed method significantly enhances the adaptability of EEG-based drowsiness detection systems in non-i.i.d. scenarios."}

Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories.

Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families.

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/τ$ rate, where $τ$ is the number of iterations. We also establish a nearly matching lower bound on the convergence rate in this regime. This is the first work to establish global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under the score matching framework."}

We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation.

To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability.

HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities.

We then test these predictions empirically across two models (Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B) and three tasks. We find that when self-grades determine rewards, models exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. While decoupling self-grades from the reward signal mitigates this inflation, models may still display lesser (but significant) overconfidence. Our results suggest that within current model scales, separating evaluation from reward removes immediate wireheading incentives. However, we caution that strictly decoupling rewards may not suffice for situationally aware models, which could learn to inflate grades for instrumental reasons (such as influencing deployment decisions) even absent direct reward coupling."}

Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains.

However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities."}

Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods, particularly using the same queries from the simulation."}

Drawing from cognitive science, we align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence: models initially produce incorrect outputs without reasoning, then begin reasoning (but still fail), eventually reason effectively, and finally solve tasks without explicit reasoning. We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping. We propose metrics to track this trajectory and argue that reasoning behavior is valuable for understanding and optimizing reasoning model training."}

Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. However, while these compressed models boast of benign performance and system-level advantages, their trustworthiness implications remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness."}

To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies."}

Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released."}

In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities."}

The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU.

However, existing optimization and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches rely on aggregated, static base station (BS) traffic models that fail to capture non-stationary traffic dynamics and suffer from large state-action spaces, limiting real-world deployment. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), referred to as MARL-DDQN, for adaptive SMO in a 3D urban environment with a time-varying and community-based user equipment (UE) mobility model. Unlike conventional single-agent RL, MARL-DDQN enables scalable, distributed decision-making with minimal signaling overhead. A realistic BS power consumption model and beamforming are integrated to accurately quantify EE, while QoS is defined in terms of throughput. The method adapts SMO policies to maximize EE while mitigating inter-cell interference and ensuring throughput fairness. Simulations show that MARL-DDQN outperforms state-of-the-art strategies, including All On, iterative QoS-aware load-based (IT-QoS-LB), MARL-DDPG, and MARL-PPO, achieving up to 0.60 Mbit/Joule EE, 8.5 Mbps 10th-percentile throughput, and meeting QoS constraints 95% of the time under dynamic scenarios."}

We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics.

Experimenting with the SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy across the synthetic persuasion dataset, we demonstrate significant variations in detection performance across language agents. Our comparative analysis reveals significant performance disparities with GPT-4 achieving superior detection accuracy on complex persuasion techniques, while open-source models like Llama3 and Mistral demonstrated notable weaknesses in identifying subtle rhetorical, suggesting that different architectures encode and process persuasive language patterns in fundamentally different ways. We show that prompt engineering dramatically affects detection efficacy, with temperature settings and confidence scoring producing model-specific variations; Gemma and GPT-4 perform optimally at lower temperatures while Llama3 and Mistral show improved capabilities at higher temperatures. Our causal analysis provides novel insights into socio-emotional-cognitive signatures of persuasion attacks, revealing that different attack types target specific cognitive dimensions.

However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios."}

To avoid frequent retraining of the decoder and to ensure the safety and comfort of the iBMI user, continuous learning is essential for real-life applications. Since Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are being recognized as a promising approach for developing resource-efficient neural decoder, we propose continuous learning approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms adapted for DSNNs. Banditron and AGREL are chosen as the two candidate RL algorithms since they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively addressing the non-stationary problem and fitting the energy constraints of implantable devices. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The accuracy of open-loop experiments conducted with DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL remains stable over extended periods. Meanwhile, the time-to-target in the closed-loop experiment with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to that of DSNN AGREL while achieving reductions of 98% in memory access usage and 99% in the requirements for multiply- and-accumulate (MAC) operations during training.

Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports.

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection."}

We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability."}

In this work, we develop a surrogate for steady state solar wind modeling, using a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). We compare our model to a previously developed numerical surrogate for this task called HUX, and we show that the SFNO achieves comparable or better performance across several metrics. Though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness, this underscores the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than a flaw in SFNO.

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment."}

Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders."}

We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation.

To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues.

This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways.

Variants of PCA are simple and interpretable, but not flexible enough to capture nonlinear data manifold structure. More flexible approaches have other problems: autoencoders are generally difficult to interpret, and graph-embedding-based methods can produce pathological distortions in manifold geometry. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a variational framework that casts dimensionality reduction algorithms as solutions to an optimal manifold embedding problem. By construction, this framework permits nonlinear embeddings, allowing its solutions to be more flexible than PCA. Moreover, the variational nature of the framework has useful consequences for interpretability: each solution satisfies a set of partial differential equations, and can be shown to reflect symmetries of the embedding objective. We discuss these features in detail and show that solutions can be analytically characterized in some cases. Interestingly, one special case exactly recovers PCA."}

Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks."}

However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \\emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment."}

Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI."}

Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance."}

The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification."}

Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released."}

Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages.

The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, contains 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) written dialogues from 179 participants across commercial aviation, e-commerce, online travel agencies, and telecommunication scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support. Findings show neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are the most frequent non-neutral emotions. Agreement is moderate for multilabel emotions and valence, lower for arousal and dominance; self-reports diverge notably from third-party labels, aligning most for neutral, gratitude, and anger. Objective strategies often elicit neutrality or gratitude, while suboptimal strategies increase anger, annoyance, disappointment, desire, and confusion. Some affective strategies (cheerfulness, gratitude) foster positive reciprocity, whereas others (apology, empathy) can also leave desire, anger, or annoyance. Temporal analysis confirms successful conversation-level steering toward prescribed trajectories, most distinctly for negative targets; positive and neutral targets yield similar final valence distributions. Benchmarks highlight the difficulty of forward-looking emotion inference from prior turns, underscoring the complexity of proactive emotion-aware support."}

We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Existing approaches either rely on elaborate prompt engineering, whose effectiveness is heavily dependent on human experience, or integrate policy networks and pre-trained policy models, which are usually difficult to adapt to new dialogue scenarios and costly to train. Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM. The proposed approach further demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks."}

PreferRead enables detailed analysis of how annotators navigate between a prompt and two candidate responses before selecting their preference. We find that annotators re-read a response in roughly half of all trials, most often revisiting the option they ultimately choose, and rarely revisit the prompt. Reading behaviors are also significantly related to annotation outcomes: re-reading is associated with higher inter-annotator agreement, whereas long reading paths and times are associated with lower agreement. These results demonstrate that reading processes provide a complementary cognitive dimension for understanding annotator reliability, decision-making and disagreement in complex, subjective NLP tasks.

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications."}

While most existing FL methods assume homogeneous model architectures, client heterogeneity in data and resources renders this assumption impractical, motivating model-heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead.

First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.\n  Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research.

Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability.

Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a \"developmental\" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior. They also join a growing body of work that highlights the value of adopting a developmental perspective when probing LM mechanisms."}

The OMD iterates are defined as solutions to optimization subproblems which, oftentimes, can be solved only approximately, leading to an inexact version of the algorithm. Nonetheless, existing OMD analyses typically assume an idealized error free setting, thereby limiting our understanding of performance guarantees that should be expected in practice. In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret."}

To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies."}

The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization.

Despite their growing sophistication, most dynamic pricing algorithms focus on optimizing the price of each product independently, disregarding potential interactions among items. By neglecting these interdependencies in consumer demand across related goods, sellers may fail to capture the full potential of coordinated pricing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring dynamic pricing mechanisms designed explicitly for complementary products, aiming to exploit their joint demand structure to maximize overall revenue. We present an online learning algorithm considering both positive and negative interactions between products' demands. The algorithm utilizes transaction data to identify advantageous complementary relationships through an integer programming problem between different items, and then optimizes pricing strategies using data-driven and computationally efficient multi-armed bandit solutions based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes. We validate our solution in a simulated environment, and we demonstrate that our solution improves the revenue w.r.t. a comparable learning algorithm ignoring such interactions."}

Without any task-specific tuning, GPS generates a tailored prompt for each unseen input, improving performance across diverse tasks. The prompter is trained with reinforcement learning on a suite of training tasks and includes a novel regularization for effectively adapting to per-sample prompting.

In this work, we introduce ResearchArcade, a graph-based interface that connects multiple academic data sources, unifies task definitions, and supports a wide range of base models to address key academic challenges. ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables.

The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/."}

ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning.

However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy."}

Traditional FL methods often use a global model to fit all clients, assuming that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID).

To address this gap, we propose FLUX, a novel clustering-based FL (CFL) framework that addresses the four most common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time. To this end, FLUX leverages privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to ensure robust performance and scalability across varying levels and types of distribution shifts. Unlike existing CFL methods addressing non-IID client distribution shifts, FLUX i) does not require any prior knowledge of the types of distribution shifts or the number of client clusters, and ii) supports test-time adaptation, enabling unseen and unlabeled clients to benefit from the most suitable cluster-specific models. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks, two real-world datasets and ten state-of-the-art baselines show that FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 23 percentage points over the best-performing baselines, while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg."}

For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent."}

To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones.

We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities.

This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization.

However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss.

We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns.

However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head.

We introduce REFINE, an ensemble AL method that combines multiple strategies without knowing in advance which will perform best. In each AL cycle, REFINE operates in two stages: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool by considering an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates capturing different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for. Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show that REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Notably, progressive filtering serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool, which we demonstrate on an audio spectrogram classification use case.

Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders.

While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. These results demonstrate that even with computationally simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo can generate realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy across a range of consonant-vowel combinations."}

Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR.

In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis.

The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question. To analyze this, we introduce RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains paired with a checklist-based evaluation framework. We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns.

Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision.

Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception."}

F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT.

We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models."}

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on fifteen commonsense and arithmetic benchmarks demonstrate that RoSA outperforms existing mainstream PEFT methods under comparable trainable parameters.

However, existing evaluation and reward mechanisms used to train and assess the text-to-SQL models remain a critical bottleneck. Current approaches heavily rely on manually annotated gold SQL queries, which are costly to produce and impractical for large-scale evaluation. More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics. To address these challenges, we propose RuCo-C, a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation using interpretable critiques without human intervention. Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques. Subsequently, it integrates densified reward feedback through a \"progressive exploration\" strategy during the RL training process, which dynamically adjusts the rewards to enhance the model's performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RuCo-C outperforms existing methods in text-to-SQL evaluation, yielding significant performance gains."}

In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection."}

This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics. Demonstrated on groundwater storage, the conclusions are applicable to other environmental variables governed by indirectly observable factors.

This research proposes and evaluates three novel token-level probability estimation approaches to bridge this gap. The aim is to enhance model interpretability and accuracy, and evaluate the generalizability of this framework across different instruction-tuned models. Through extensive experimentation on a synthetically generated, rigorously annotated dataset, it is demonstrated that leveraging token logits significantly improves the interpretability and reliability of generative classifiers, enabling more nuanced content safety moderation."}

This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting."}

We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates.

We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge.

The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems."}

Most systems use cascaded frameworks that decode phonemes before assembling sentences with an n-gram language model (LM), preventing joint optimization of all stages simultaneously. Here, we introduce an end-to-end Brain-to-Text (BIT) framework that translates neural activity into coherent sentences using a single differentiable neural network. Central to our approach is a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, whose representations transfer to both attempted and imagined speech. In a cascaded setting with an n-gram LM, the pretrained encoder establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Brain-to-Text '24 and '25 benchmarks. Integrated end-to-end with audio large language models (LLMs) and trained with contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment, BIT reduces the word error rate (WER) of the prior end-to-end method from 24.69% to 10.22%. Notably, we find that small-scale audio LLMs markedly improve end-to-end decoding. Beyond record-setting performance, BIT aligns attempted and imagined speech embeddings to enable cross-task generalization.

It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks.

However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\\%$ on trustworthiness metrics.

In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF).

The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificing accuracy.This study also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection."}

We first show that derivations using Sideward Merge are possible for all of these cases: these respect EC, though they involve some amount of optimality violations, with respect to Resource Restrictions cost functions, andthe amount of violation differs among these cases. We show that all the cases that involve large optimality violations can be derived in alternative ways involving neither EC nor the use of SM. The main remaining case (head-to-head movement) only involves SM with minimal violations of optimality (near equilibrium fluctuations). We analyze explicitly also the cases of multiple wh-fronting, clusters of clitics in Romance languages and possessor agreement construction in Korean, and how an explanation of these phenomena based on SM can be made compatible with the colored operad generators for phases and theta roles. We also show that the EC condition has a clear algebraic meaning in the mathematical formulation of Merge and is therefore an intrinsic structural algebraic constraint of the model, rather than an additional assumption. We also show that the minimal optimality violating SM plays a structural role in the Markovian properties of Merge, and we compare different optimality conditions coming from Minimal Search and from Resource Restriction in terms of their effect on the dynamics of the Hopf algebra Markov chain, in a simple explicit example."}

This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality.

Despite significant advancements, state-of-the-art multilingual models still face challenges in handling Romanized script, where the Roman alphabet is adopted to represent the phonetic structure of diverse languages. Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel transliteration dataset for two popular Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi and Bengali, which are ranked as the 3rd and 7th most spoken languages worldwide. Our dataset comprises nearly 1.8 million Hindi and 1 million Bengali transliteration pairs.

The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Neural Processes (NPs), particularly Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), provide scalable probabilistic models with uncertainty estimates, making them well-suited for data-driven sensor placement. However, existing approaches rely on total predictive uncertainty, which conflates epistemic and aleatoric components, that may lead to suboptimal sensor selection in ambiguous regions. To address this, we propose expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement. To enable this, we extend ConvCNPs with a Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head for epistemic uncertainty estimation. Preliminary results suggest that epistemic uncertainty driven sensor placement more effectively reduces model error than approaches based on overall uncertainty."}

In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection."}

However, there is a growing concern regarding their lack of sensitivity, factual incorrectness in responses, inconsistent expressions of empathy, bias, hallucinations, and overall inability to capture the depth and complexity of human understanding, especially in low-resource and sensitive domains such as psychology. To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift\" in therapeutic settings. Our work contributes not only to the MI community by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to address data scarcity in low-resource domains but also critical insights for using LLMs for precise contextual interpretation in complex behavioral therapy."}

However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible. We also empirically find that a high $λ_{\\text{GAE}}$ around 0.9, and using RNNs instead of just feed-forward layers in the actor-critic architecture, strongly increase inter-seed cross-play. While these results demonstrate the dramatic effect that hyperparameters can have not just on self-play scores but also on cross-play scores, we show that there are simple Dec-POMDPs though, in which standard policy gradient methods with increased entropy regularization are not able to achieve perfect inter-seed cross-play, thus demonstrating the continuing necessity for new algorithms for zero-shot coordination."}

Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as \"geo-sensors\" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., \"The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece.\" contains impacted location \"Mati\" and non-impacted locations \"Greece\" and \"Athens\". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders."}

In litigation, expert commissioners, such as physicians, architects, accountants, and engineers, provide specialized knowledge to help judges clarify points of dispute. When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand.

Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection."}

In this paper, we use a recently introduced multidimensional threshold-based classification framework to extend such score-oriented losses to multiclass classification, defining the Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions. As also demonstrated by several classification experiments, this proposed family of losses is designed to preserve the main advantages observed in the binary setting, such as the direct optimization of the target metric and the robustness to class imbalance, achieving performance comparable to other state-of-the-art loss functions and providing new insights into the interaction between simplex geometry and score-oriented learning."}

Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI."}

In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information.

Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs."}

Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM."}

Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model."}

IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including \"Financial fraud\", \"Indirect marketing\", \"Political propaganda\", as well as \"Fear mongering\".

In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we validate our method on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing that it can steer pre-trained generative models to optimize objectives and solve practically relevant tasks beyond the reach of current fine-tuning schemes."}

The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design. The results support the practicality of the approach for use with various dynamical systems."}

Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant. Notably, on out-of-domain datasets, our method remains highly effective and outperforms the training-based method EAGLE-3 by 1.62x."}

Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios."}

While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed \"PathReasoning\", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection.

But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them. We provide evidence from conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies. We also discuss the potential of several proposed empirical workarounds to these problems and argue that while they seem valuable, they also seem insufficient alone. Progress on deception detection likely requires further consideration of these problems."}

In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats.

Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection."}

In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augment existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop-directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO).

This article addresses temporal text classification using interpretable, feature-engineered tree-based machine learning models. We integrate five feature categories - compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, and distance features - to predict the temporal origin of English texts spanning five centuries. Comparative analysis shows that these feature domains provide complementary temporal signals, with combined models outperforming any individual feature set. On a large-scale corpus, we achieve 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines (20% and 2.3%). Under relaxed temporal precision, performance increases to 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades. The final model exhibits strong ranking capabilities with AUCROC up to 94.8% and AUPRC up to 83.3%, and maintains controlled errors with mean absolute deviations of 27 years and 30 years, respectively. For authentication-style tasks, binary models around key thresholds (e.g., 1850-1900) reach 85-98% accuracy. Feature importance analysis identifies distance features and lexical structure as most informative, with compression-based features providing complementary signals. SHAP explainability reveals systematic linguistic evolution patterns, with the 19th century emerging as a pivot point across feature domains.

While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach against other look-ahead techniques, and show how the flow map enables engagement with complicated reward functions that make possible new forms of image editing, e.g. by interfacing with vision language models."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers.

Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of our model."}

There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text.

This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks.

Accepted to KDD 2026 (Research Track)", "summary": "Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly \"black boxes\" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art."}

Five models -- including GPT-4 and lightweight open-source alternatives -- are tested across three heterogeneous datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) and two prompting strategies (minimal vs. enriched with linguistic and psychological cues). Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance, but also introduce a systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies substantially: Openness and Agreeableness are relatively easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value. These findings show that current out-of-the-box LLMs are not yet suitable for APPT, and that careful coordination of prompt design, trait framing, and evaluation metrics is essential for interpretable results."}

In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%)."}

However, acquiring CSI incurs significant overhead, consuming up to 25\\% of spectrum resources in 5G networks due to frequent pilot transmissions at sub-millisecond intervals. Recent approaches aim to reduce this burden by reconstructing CSI from spatiotemporal RF measurements, such as signal strength and direction-of-arrival. While effective in offline settings, these methods often suffer from inference latencies in the 5--100~ms range, making them impractical for real-time systems. We present GSpaRC: Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Reconstruction of RF Channels, the first algorithm to break the 1 ms latency barrier while maintaining high accuracy. GSpaRC represents the RF environment using a compact set of 3D Gaussian primitives, each parameterized by a lightweight neural model augmented with physics-informed features such as distance-based attenuation. Unlike traditional vision-based splatting pipelines, GSpaRC is tailored for RF reception: it employs an equirectangular projection onto a hemispherical surface centered at the receiver to reflect omnidirectional antenna behavior. A custom CUDA pipeline enables fully parallelized directional sorting, splatting, and rendering across frequency and spatial dimensions. Evaluated on multiple RF datasets, GSpaRC achieves similar CSI reconstruction fidelity to recent state-of-the-art methods while reducing training and inference time by over an order of magnitude. By trading modest GPU computation for a substantial reduction in pilot overhead, GSpaRC enables scalable, low-latency channel estimation suitable for deployment in 5G and future wireless systems.

To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives.

However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%.

We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception.

Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation.

We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows.

Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship.

Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations.

Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design."}

However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable. Extensive experiments show consistent gains across class priors, dataset scales, and class counts -- without heuristic stabilization -- while exhibiting robustness to overfitting."}

While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems."}

Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models."}

To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a \"short is long\" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning."}

The model comprises three components: a fuel mix predictor that estimates the contribution of different generation sources, an air quality converter that models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, and a health impact assessor that translates resulting pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Across multiple regions in the United States, our health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors in terms of public health impacts than fuel mix-driven baselines. A case study on electric vehicle charging schedules illustrates the public health gains enabled by our method and the actionable guidance it can offer for health-informed energy management.

In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting.

In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

A comprehensive understanding of selective SSMs in runtime behavior, resource utilization patterns, and scaling characteristics still remains unexplored, thus obstructing their optimal deployment and further architectural improvements. This paper presents a thorough empirical study of Mamba-1 and Mamba-2, systematically profiled for performance to assess the design principles that contribute to their efficiency in state-space modeling. A detailed analysis of computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties was performed for sequence lengths ranging from 64 to 16384 tokens. Our findings show that the SSM component, a central part of the selective SSM architecture, demands a significant portion of computational resources compared to other components in the Mamba block. Based on these insights, we propose a pruning technique that selectively removes low-activity states within the SSM component, achieving measurable throughput and memory gains while maintaining accuracy within a moderate pruning regime. This approach results in performance improvements across varying sequence lengths, achieving a 1.14x speedup and reducing memory usage by 11.50\\%.

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications.

To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts. This substantially reduces inference cost and leaves almost the entire context window available for user inputs."}

We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.\n  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.\n  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations.

Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting."}

HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities.

Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents.

We integrate HSA into Transformers to build HSA-UltraLong, which is an 8B-parameter MoE model trained on over 8 trillion tokens and is rigorously evaluated on different tasks with in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths to demonstrate its capability in handling ultra-long contexts. Results show that our model performs comparably to full-attention baselines on in-domain lengths while achieving over 90\\% accuracy on most in-context retrieval tasks with contexts up to 16M.

At its core is the Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG), a compact, region-centric memory where each node aggregates multi-view keyframe and object semantics, capturing both appearance and spatial structure while preserving viewpoint diversity. At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target. To further enhance viewpoint alignment and goal recognition, we introduce VGGT-adapter, a lightweight geometric module built on the pre-trained VGGT model, which aligns observation and goal features in a shared 3D-aware space. MG-Nav operates global planning and local control at different frequencies, using periodic re-localization to correct errors. Experiments on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks demonstrate that MG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and remains robust under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions."}

However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. However, while these compressed models boast of benign performance and system-level advantages, their trustworthiness implications remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness."}

To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner.

While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark."}

This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features."}

We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction.

However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers.

The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance."}

Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of token importance in improving DPO effectiveness. It is observed that identical or semantically similar content (defined as ambiguous content) frequently appears within the preference pairs. We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAO consistently and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in performance, without markedly increasing response length, across multiple model scales and widely adopted benchmark datasets, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard.

Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios."}

Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead.

Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT. These results highlight structured input as a simple yet effective lever for more efficient LLM reasoning."}

Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings."}

However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks.

MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states.

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios.

Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods."}

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks."}

Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the \"scale-at-all-costs\" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead.

The focus is on developing online attack predictors that detect attacks in real time and identify the current stage of the attack. While such predictors have been proposed in the recent literature, these works typically rely on constructing a monolithic predictor tailored to a specific attack type and scenario. Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them. Using public datasets for training and evaluation, we provide many examples of modular predictors and show how an effective predictor can be dynamically assembled during training from a network of modular components."}

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

Project page: https://yaourtb.github.io/Splat-SAP", "summary": "We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering."}

Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling."}

Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking."}

However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset.

By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier.

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains.

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar.

We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of these models on datasets spanning from tens of millions to billions of web document titles. SPLADE and Expanded-SPLADE, which utilize sparse lexical representations, demonstrate superior retrieval performance compared to BM25, especially for complex queries. However, these models incur higher computational costs. We introduce pruning strategies, including document-centric pruning and top-k query term selection, boolean query with term threshold to mitigate these costs and improve the models' efficiency without significantly sacrificing retrieval performance. The results show that Expanded-SPLADE strikes the best balance between effectiveness and efficiency, particularly when handling large datasets.

We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.\n  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability.

Assessing the impact of visible-thermal image fusion for automated wildlife detection", "comment": "19 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation", "summary": "Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys."}

We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations.

Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction.

We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate.

We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult.

We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments."}

To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks.

While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research."}

We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers.

We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings."}

While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities.

Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement.

While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as \"think with image\", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a \"short is long\" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments."}

Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges.

Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing.

First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings.

FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data.

While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution.

We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines.

However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation.

In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning.

We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon."}

However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start.

Although some neural-network-based solutions predict layout-level performance directly from netlists, they often face generalization challenges due to the black-box heuristics of commercial placement-and-routing tools, which create disparate data across designs. To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions. Next, we rely on EDA tools for timing analysis, offloading the long-path numerical reasoning. Finally, ParaGate performs global calibration using subgraph features. Experiments show that ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data: on openE906, its arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897. These results demonstrate that ParaGate could provide guidance for global optimization in the synthesis and placement stages."}

Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources."}

First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks.

In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments."}

We define this as the multi-LLM RTL generation problem. We propose VeriDispatcher, a multi-LLM RTL generation framework that dispatches each RTL task to suitable LLMs based on pre-inference difficulty prediction. For each model, we train a compact classifier over semantic embeddings of task descriptions, using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants that combine syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs. Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval, VeriDispatcher achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls, and on VerilogEval maintains accuracy while reducing commercial usage by 25%, enabling cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation."}

We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions."}

(ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $β$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $αn$ for any constant $0 < α\\le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(β-o(1))$-robustness. Additionally, we show that the competitive ratio degrades smoothly between consistency and robustness with increasing prediction error."}

In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously.

Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy."}

Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation."}

Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches.

In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \\textbf{250$\\times$} faster inference speed.

While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL."}

In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning.

Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic."}

While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy.

SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities.

By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness.

In this work, we investigate the impact of \\emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment."}

The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

We introduce a robust evaluation framework that assesses model performance on 2,800 carefully curated questions from cardiovascular, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, and respiratory medicine domains. Our dataset distinguishes between attending physician and senior physician difficulty levels, providing nuanced insights into model capabilities across varying complexity. Our empirical analysis reveals substantial performance variations among models, with Mixtral-8x7B achieving the highest overall accuracy of 74.25%, followed by DeepSeek-R1-671B at 64.07%. Notably, we observe no consistent correlation between model size and performance, as evidenced by the strong performance of smaller mixture-of-experts architectures. The evaluation demonstrates significant performance gaps between medical specialties, with models generally performing better on cardiovascular and neurology questions compared to gastroenterology and nephrology domains. Furthermore, our analysis indicates minimal performance degradation between attending and senior physician levels for top-performing models, suggesting robust generalization capabilities.

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models."}

However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content.

To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for.

To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence.

LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%."}

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows."}

However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions.

Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D.

This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process.

We present the first benchmark that isolates procedural memory retrieval from task execution, evaluating whether agents can recognize functionally equivalent procedures that span different object instantiations. Using ALFWorld, we construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods using systematically stratified queries. Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders. Our benchmark offers the first diagnostic framework separating genuine procedural understanding from surface-level memorization and gives tools for developing retrieval systems capable of dependable generalization.

However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%.

Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering.

Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations.

However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric.

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models."}

The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.\n  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score.

This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency.

This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces.

Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives."}

Cham: Springer Nature Switzerland", "summary": "Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity."}

This thesis unifies our developments in three broad domains: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for efficient high-dimensional integration, Gaussian process (GP) regression for high-dimensional interpolation with built-in uncertainty quantification, and scientific machine learning (sciML) for modeling partial differential equations (PDEs) with mesh-free solvers. For QMC, we built new algorithms for vectorized error estimation and developed QMCPy (https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/): an open-source Python interface to randomized low-discrepancy sequence generators, automatic variable transforms, adaptive error estimation procedures, and diverse use cases. For GPs, we derived new digitally-shift-invariant kernels of higher-order smoothness, developed novel fast multitask GP algorithms, and produced the scalable Python software FastGPs (https://alegresor.github.io/fastgps/). For sciML, we developed a new algorithm capable of machine precision recovery of PDEs with random coefficients. We have also studied a number of applications including GPs for probability of failure estimation, multilevel GPs for the Darcy flow equation, neural surrogates for modeling radiative transfer, and fast GPs for Bayesian multilevel QMC."}

However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN."}

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows."}

Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment."}

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings."}

Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments."}

Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles."}

Our approach is based on worst-case confidence bounds on the bias introduced by standard trimming practices, under explicit assumptions necessary to extrapolate counterfactual estimates from regions of overlap to those without. Empirically, we demonstrate how our sensitivity framework protects against spurious findings by quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited overlap."}

Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research."}

Mean-variance regression models, which predict both a mean and residual noise for each data point, provide a simple approach to uncertainty quantification. However, overparameterized mean-variance models struggle with signal-to-noise ambiguity, deciding whether prediction targets should be attributed to signal (mean) or noise (variance). At one extreme, models fit all training targets perfectly with zero residual noise, while at the other, they provide constant, uninformative predictions and explain the targets as noise. We observe a sharp phase transition between these extremes, driven by model regularization. Empirical studies with varying regularization levels illustrate this transition, revealing substantial variability across repeated runs. To explain this behavior, we develop a statistical field theory framework, which captures the observed phase transition in alignment with experimental results. This analysis reduces the regularization hyperparameter search space from two dimensions to one, significantly lowering computational costs. Experiments on UCI datasets and the large-scale ClimSim dataset demonstrate robust calibration performance, effectively quantifying predictive uncertainty."}

Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations.

While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark."}

To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models."}

Based on this loss function, we develop a corresponding SVM model called RHPSVM (Rescaled Huberized Pinball Loss Support Vector Machine). Theoretical analyses demonstrate that RHPSVM conforms to Bayesian rules, has a strict generalization error bound, a bounded influence function, and controllable optimality conditions, ensuring excellent classification accuracy, outlier insensitivity, and resampling stability. Additionally, RHPSVM can be extended to various advanced SVM variants by adjusting parameters, enhancing its flexibility. We transform the non-convex optimization problem of RHPSVM into a series of convex subproblems using the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and solve it with the ClipDCD algorithm, which is proven to be convergent. Experimental results on simulated data, UCI datasets, and small-sample crop leaf image classification tasks show that RHPSVM outperforms existing SVM models in both noisy and noise-free scenarios, especially in handling high-dimensional small-sample data."}

To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions. Next, we rely on EDA tools for timing analysis, offloading the long-path numerical reasoning. Finally, ParaGate performs global calibration using subgraph features. Experiments show that ParaGate achieves strong generalization with minimal fine-tuning data: on openE906, its arrival-time R2 from 0.119 to 0.897. These results demonstrate that ParaGate could provide guidance for global optimization in the synthesis and placement stages."}

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime.

To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders."}

To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training.

It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the \"affective gap\". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks."}

We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances."}

DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional.

To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner.

In this paper, we investigate the generalization and privacy performances of the differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) algorithm, which is a private variant of the gradient descent (GD) by incorporating additional noise into the gradients during each iteration. Moreover, we identify a concrete learning task where DP-GD can achieve superior generalization performance compared to GD in training two-layer Huberized ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we demonstrate that, under mild conditions, a small signal-to-noise ratio can result in GD producing training models with poor test accuracy, whereas DP-GD can yield training models with good test accuracy and privacy guarantees if the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small. This indicates that DP-GD has the potential to enhance model performance while ensuring privacy protection in certain learning tasks.

Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic."}

Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\\%--34.7\\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications.

Jeff Hong"], "title": "UCB for Large-Scale Pure Exploration: Beyond Sub-Gaussianity", "comment": null, "summary": "Selecting the best alternative from a finite set represents a broad class of pure exploration problems. Traditional approaches to pure exploration have predominantly relied on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions on the performance distributions of all alternatives, which limit their applicability to non-sub-Gaussian especially heavy-tailed problems. The need to move beyond sub-Gaussianity may become even more critical in large-scale problems, which tend to be especially sensitive to distributional specifications. In this paper, motivated by the widespread use of upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms in pure exploration and beyond, we investigate their performance in the large-scale, non-sub-Gaussian settings. We consider the simplest category of UCB algorithms, where the UCB value for each alternative is defined as the sample mean plus an exploration bonus that depends only on its own sample size. We abstract this into a meta-UCB algorithm and propose letting it select the alternative with the largest sample size as the best upon stopping. For this meta-UCB algorithm, we first derive a distribution-free lower bound on the probability of correct selection. Building on this bound, we analyze two general non-sub-Gaussian scenarios: (1) all alternatives follow a common location-scale structure and have bounded variance; and (2) when such a structure does not hold, each alternative has a bounded absolute moment of order $q > 3$. In both settings, we show that the meta-UCB algorithm and therefore a broad class of UCB algorithms can achieve the sample optimality. These results demonstrate the applicability of UCB algorithms for solving large-scale pure exploration problems with non-sub-Gaussian distributions. Numerical experiments support our results and provide additional insights into the comparative behaviors of UCB algorithms within and beyond our meta-UCB framework."}

We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\\times$ to $10\\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements.

To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT."}

We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \\textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications.

This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback.

To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach.

Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies."}

Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed."}

Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks."}

We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs."}

There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks.

However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o."}

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking."}

To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay.

To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing.

We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \\textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution.

To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift\" in therapeutic settings.

Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy.

To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%."}

Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model."}

We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset.

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings."}

This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget."}

To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments."}

These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain."}

Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\\times$ 1024).

Second, we uncover a \"phase transition\" phenomenon governed by the subsampling rate $β$ (where $s \\asymp n^β$). We prove that in the bias-dominated regime ($β\\ge 1/2$), which corresponds to large subsample sizes typically favored in practice to maximize predictive accuracy, standard inference breaks down as the estimator converges to a deterministic bias constant rather than a zero-mean normal distribution.

To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance.

Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models."}

Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure.

In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer.

To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability."}

In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to \"think with videos\". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models.

Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning.

Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking.

The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements.

We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting.

A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates.

The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}

We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models."}

Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers."}

Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint.

Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment.

Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm.

We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities."}

Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic."}
