The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and\nnoise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the\nbest response quickly.

LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries.

For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity.

This preserves the residual and attention topologies\nand increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original\nfunctionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,\nwhich maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented\ninitialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative\nAdaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to\nacquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as\nSCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and\nSCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing\nbetween preservation and adaptation heads.

First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our\nmethod consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%\nhigher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This\nsets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone\ntowards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains."}

We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural\nAggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine\nmultiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures\ntemporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to\ndifferent input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained\nsingle-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and\nsimple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across\nmultiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging\nfrom polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other\nmultimodal physiological applications."}

These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous\naction settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging\nexpert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter\nsensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset\nsizes and hyperparameter configurations."}

Our model for\nSobolev training reflects practical implementations by sketching gradient data\nonto finite dimensional subspaces. By combining the replica method from\nstatistical physics with linearizations in operator-valued free probability\ntheory, we derive a closed-form description for the generalization errors of\nthe trained RF models. For target functions described by single-index models,\nwe demonstrate that supplementing function data with additional gradient data\ndoes not universally improve predictive performance.

In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior.
